News:
        Take note:  Priests (and Paladins) now need spellbooks to learn spells.
Bugs:
        "probing" sometimes completely ignores a monster...  This may be
          related to the "monster heal bug" (which has been patched over,
          not truly fixed), but I don't know.
        Sometimes "special offers" in the stores seem to be ignored -- the
          shopkeeper asks for full price.  This seems to happen only with
          "stackable" items like arrows, etc.
