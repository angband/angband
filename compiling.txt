Compiling Instructions
======================

The methods for compiling Angband vary by platform and by build system. If
you get Angband working on a different platform or build system please let us
know so we can add to this file.

BUILDING ON Mac OS X
====================

Native builds
-------------

To build the new Cocoa front-end:

    cd src
    make -f Makefile.cocoa

To build the legacy Carbon front-end (which is deprecated):

    cd src
    make -f Makefile.osx



BUILDING ON LINUX / *NIX
========================

Native builds
-------------

Linux builds using autotools. There are several different front ends that you
can optionally build (GCU, SDL, X11, and GTK) using arguments to configure
such as --enable-sdl, --disable-gtk, etc. Each front end has different
dependencies (e.g. ncurses, SDL libraries, etc).

To build Angband to be run in-place:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --with-no-install [other options as needed]
    make

To build Angband to be installed in some other location:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix /path/to [other options as needed ]
    make
    make install

On some BSDs, you may need to copy install-sh into lib/ and various
subdirectories of lib/ in order to install correctly.


Cross-building for Windows with Mingw
-------------------------------------

Many developers (as well as the auto-builder) build Angband for Windows using
Mingw on Linux. This requires that the necessary Mingw packages are all
installed.

This type of build now also uses autotools, so you must configure it to
cross-compile, e.g.

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --enable-win --disable-curses --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=i586-mingw32msvc  

Mingw installs commands like 'i586-mingw32msvc-gcc'. The value of --host
should be that same command with the '-gcc' removed. Instead of i586 you may
see i686, amd64, etc. The value of --build should be the host you're building
on. (See http://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/
autoconf-2.68/html_node/Specifying-Target-Triplets.html#Specifying%20Names for
gory details of how these triplets are arrived at)

TODO: you will probably need to manually disable curses, or the host curses
installation will be found, and will not be able to link properly. More
checking of permissible combinations to configure is necessary 



BUILDING ON WINDOWS
===================

Using MinGW
-----------

This build now also uses autotools, so should be very similar to the Linux
build:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --enable-win
	make
	
The install target almost certainly won't work

Following build, to get the program to run, you need to copy the executable
from the src directory into the top-level dir, and copy 2 DLLs (libpng12.dll
and zlib1.dll) from src/win/dll to the top-level dir 


Using Cygwin (with MinGW)
-------------------------

Use the Cygwin setup.exe to install the mingw-gcc-core package and any
dependencies suggested by the installer.

Run these commands:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --enable-win --with-no-install --host=i686-pc-mingw32
	make

As with the "Using MinGW" process, you need to copy the executable and
DLLs to the top-level dir.


Using eclipse (Indigo) on Windows (with MinGW)
----------------------------------------------

For eclipse with EGit, select File | Import..., Git | Projects from Git, Next >
Clone your/the upstream repo, or Add your existing cloned repo, Next >
Select "Use the New Projects Wizard", Finish
In the New Project Wizard, select C/C++ | Makefile Project with Existing Code, Next >
Give the project a name (Angband),
	navigate to the repo you cloned in "Existing Code Location",
	Select "C", but not "C++"
	Choose "MinGW GCC" Toolchain, Finish
Once the project is set up, r-click | Properties
go to C/C++ Build | Toolchain Editor, select "Gnu Make Builder" instead of
	"CDT Internal Builder"
go to C/C++ Build, uncheck "Generate Makefiles automatically"  

You still need to run ./autogen.sh and ./configure manually, outside eclipse
(see above)	
  

Using Visual Studio
-------------------

Using Dev-C++
