The stats generation code aims to make it easy to analyze object generation,
monster generation, and other Angband processes suitable for Monte Carlo
simulation. The supplied perl script (run-stats) repeatedly invokes the 
angband executable with the stats pseudo-visual module. Each call initializes
a player, walks her down the dungeon, and, for each dungeon level between one
and ninety-nine, kills all the monsters on the generated map and dumps 
information about the monsters and objects therein. The perl script then
collects this information and outputs statistics about it as desired.
