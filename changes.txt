Angband 3.0.7s, beta 3
Suggestions and (more) patches welcomed.

Another, probably mildly annoying, release of Angband "3.0.7s".  This is really
almost entirely other people's work; thanks go to Hugo Kornelis, Pete Mack,
Marco K and Frank Palazzolo.  The main gameplay difference is that wands and
staves now have sensible starting charges again.

Changes:
- Browsing books now displays information about the spells therein, if
  requested.  As part of this, move spell names/descriptions/locations
  out into a new file, spell.txt.  (Hugo Kornelis)
- If a stack of rods is recharging, you'll get a message when the first 
  rod is recharged and another message when they are all recharged.
  There is no message when the second, third, etc., rod is recharged.
  (Hugo Kornelis)
- The recharge notification will now disturb you if you have set the 
  option to be disturbed when boring things happen (disturb_minor) to 
  yes.  (Hugo Kornelis)
- Add console mode patch for Windows (Frank Palazzolo).  This is 
  basically playing the game in an old-school terminal window for
  those who like uncluttered gameplay.
- Get "./configure" working properly again (Marco K).
- Renew Mac support; now works on OS X 10.3 onwards, but the old 
  main-mac has been removed, as has the MPW makefile.  (Pete Mack)
- Added support for improved pluralization of object names.  Allow
  custom plurals for words which need them (e.g. "Kni|fe|ves" and
  "M|ous|ic|e").  Unused at present.  (Hugo Kornelis)
- Bugfix: Monsters that resist one or more of acid, lightning, fire, 
  cold, poison and water *and* resist one or more of nether, plasma, 
  nexus and disenchantment had two "it resists ..." sentences in the 
  monster info.  (Hugo Kornelis)
- Bugfix: Sustain CON was reported before Sustain DEX in self knowledge.
  Since DEX is reported before CON in all other situations, this is now
  reversed.  (Hugo Kornelis)
- Removed Lua.
- Arrow keys are now distinct from the numeric movement keys, and because
  of this you can now edit text at prompts in game properly.  Supported
  on Windows, Mac (untested), and main-gcu.c.  If you get it working for
  anything else, please tell me so I can update the patch.
- Charges for wands/staves are customisable in the lib/edit/ files.
- Autosquelch support.  (Taken originally from NPP, but heavily
  cleaned up.)
- Considerably simplify and speed up main-gcu.c.  (Thanks to Christer
  Nyfalt.)
- Various code cleanups (including removing VMS support, cleaning up
  file handling, and fixing memory leaks).
- main-x11 now reads window placement from x11-settings.prf.
- Fixed Windows bug where you can't move one of the font files after
  having played a game this reboot.  (Thanks to Leon Marrick.)
- Resizing the game window automatically updates its contents, on
  platforms which support this.
- 'next_xp' option to show experience needed for the next level,
  rather than how much you have now (fixed in s2).
- Inscribing an item with '!t' will now confirm if you try to take it
  off.
- Set wrapping width to 72 for character dumps' item information, to
  avoid well-behaved newsreaders messing them up.
- Add platform-specific ifdefs to readdib.c and main-ami.c.
- Add the recharging fix from V CVS -- things can now explode when you
  recharge them once more.


Changes Angband 3.0.6:
- Wands and staves are no longer destroyed when a recharge attempt
  backfires.  Instead all the charges are drained.
- Renamed the artifact short sword 'Gilettar' to 'Dagmor' since that
  name is mentioned for the sword of Beren in Tolkien's notes.
  (suggested by Tyler Witter)
- Added a new type of subwindow for displaying the dungeon area around
  the player.
- Added a new subwindow type "Display player (compact)" that displays
  the left-hand-side of the main term (player stats, hitpoints, gold,
  ...) in a separate window.
- Added a new window type that displays the info from the status line.
- Turned the "scroll map while targetting" option permanently on.
- Added a display of the temporary resists to the status line.  The
  resists are only displayed if there is enough room after the dungeon
  level (when using a main or status term with at least 85 cols).
  The verbosity of the output (between "Acid Elec Fire Cold Pois" and
  "AEFCP") depends on the term width.
- Display the player's speed in the character dump and on the info page.
- Identified scrolls can now look different from unidentified ones.
  This allows the use of the individual scroll tiles created by David
  Gervais.
- Allow the ammo-branding activation of 'Cubragol' to be aborted without
  using up the charge. (Diego Gonzalez and Jeff Greene)
- Use actual monster and object symbols instead of a list of hardcoded
  symbols when hallucinating.
- Added Craig Oliver's Sound FX Patch version 1.1 that adds about 120
  new sound events to the game.
  (see also http://www.chambrook.org/angband/soundfx.php)
- Scroll the map when the player is 1/4th of the visible grids away from
  the edge of the map display.
- Allow the OS X version to be started from a read-only medium, for
  example from a disk image or a central installation under
  'Applications'.  All user-specific files like savefiles, scores,
  char-dumps, and saved preferences are stored in
  'Library/Preferences/Angband/' and its subfolders inside the user's
  home directory.
- The Mac OS X application bundle now includes all the necessary files
  from the lib folder.  The separate lib folder in the distribution is
  no longer necessary.  This means that the OS X version can now be
  installed by simply dragging the application icon to the target
  directory.
- The OS X version would crash when changing the sound or graphics
  options before a character was created or loaded. (reported by Patrick
  Hughes)
- Don't save the Mac OS X preferences on exit if the game hasn't been
  initialized properly to prevent corruption of the preference file in
  case of an error at startup.  Skip loading the preference file if it
  is broken. (problem reported by Matt Stone)
- Include the basic Angband sound files per default in the OS X version.
- Made the tile size independent of the font size in the X11 version.
  Store various window settings like the window size between sessions.
- Don't add a hardcoded 'games' subdirectory to the installation path on
  multi-user machines.
- Allow all user created files to be saved in subdirectories under
  ~/.angband/Angband/ when PRIVATE_USER_PATH is defined.
- Allow the use of the 'vcs' display module on systems with devfs-style
  '/dev/vc/*' terminals.
- The virtual console (vcs) front-end does now implement cursor
  visibility and bigscreen support.  (Alexander Ulyanov)
- Enable cursor visibility in the "gcu" front-end on Linux systems.
  (Alexander Ulyanov)
- Fixed a bug in the Xaw frontend, which made Angband crash if the main
  window geometry was specified as an X resource. (Alexander Ulyanov)
- Make X11 frontends show floors as centered dots, walls as blocks, and
  treasures as diamonds. (Alexander Ulyanov)
- Removed the restriction of bigtile mode to the main window in the X11
  version.
- Added Alexander Ulyanov's Linux framebuffer display module from:
  http://posband.earthsea.org/misc/angband-lfb-20050220.tar.gz
- Added compile instructions for MinGW/MSYS on Windows. (Tuomas
  Härkönen)
- Added compile instructions for gcc on Mac OS X.
- Fixed a stupid bug that could cause the game to hang or crash when
  killing quest monsters near the edge of the dungeon. (Ivan Tuckwell
  and Dr. Andrew White)
- Added missing tiles and tile assignments for the 32x32 tiles. (Ivan
  Jekic and David Gervais)
- The charges of rods of perception weren't handled correctly when
  compiling with scripting turned off. (reported by "Twilight" and Jeff
  Greene)
- Cursed speed rings should not increase the level feeling. (Anssi
  Ramela and Jeff Greene)
- Refresh the list of visible monsters after (Mass) Banishment,
  Earthquake, and Destruction spells, when using the 'delete nearby
  monsters' function in debug mode, as well as when pressing Ctrl-R.
  ("Twilight")
- Don't try to write zero-length blocks when saving the lib/data/*.raw
  files. (suggested by Juha Niemimaki)
- Corrected the item description for scrolls of recharging. (reported by
  Hugo Kornelis)
- Fixed a Angband 3.0.6 alpha 1 specific crash with the Mac OS X 10.4
  (Tiger) caused by releasing a reference that should not be released.
  (reported by Harry Erwin)
- The experience loss as a result of one of the One Ring's activations
  is now 1/4 of both max and current experience instead of the
  unintended reduction of max exp by 3/16 of the current experience.
  (Hugo Kornelis)
- Cleaned up the handling of experience draining when the player has
  Hold Life. The fixed part of the exp drain by nether breaths is now
  also reduced by Hold Life. (Hugo Kornelis)
- The 'star ball' activation fired one ball more when scripting was
  enabled.  (Hugo Kornelis)
- The object description for the 'cure wounds' activation reads
  "activates for cure wounds (4d7)", but it actually cures 4d8 points of
  damage.  The description has been fixed. (Hugo Kornelis)
- The "recharge item" artifact activation can now be canceled at the
  "Recharge which item" prompt without draining the artifact's charge.
  (Hugo Kornelis)
- The symbol for the Shield of Deflection was a light blue [ instead of
  a ) like all other shields. (Hugo Kornelis)
- Reduced the price for "Raal's Tome of Destruction". (Hugo Kornelis and
  Timo Pietila)

Changes in Angband 3.0.5:
- Summoned creatures appear near the caster now instead of near the
  player.
- Made rods of detection invulnerable to electric attacks.
- Restored the old behavior of the Glyph of Warding to protect against
  direct melee attacks when standing on it.
- Rods can no longer be drained by monsters.
- The minor vault "Interlock" had switched height and width definitions,
  causing it to be created in a chaotic state. (Werner Baer)
- Spells that prompt the user for an item (identify, enchantment,
  recharging) or an monster letter (banishment) no longer use mana if
  canceled.
- The order of mage spells in the books in the non-Lua version is now
  the same as in the Lua version.
- Give energy to monsters and the player at the end of the game turn
  instead of at the start.  This prevents various odd effects when
  loading a saved game. (reported by Phil)
- The activation descriptions for rings were missing with Lua scripting
  turned off. (Jeff Greene)
- The SHATTER (earthquake) attack of monsters can cause the player to be
  pushed into another position.  Processing of the remaining blows of
  the monster should stop in that case. Otherwise the player could get
  hit "through a wall" that was created by the earthquake. (Jeff Greene)
- Removed the autoroller delay.
- Cleaned up the paragraph handling in the object descriptions.
  (Hallvard B Furuseth)
- "It cannot be harmed by acid and fire" should be "... acid *or* fire".
  (Hallvard B Furuseth)
- Piles of wands, staves, and rods can be used from the ground without
  picking them up first.
- Fixed a problem in the Unix/Linux makefiles.  The POSIX standard
  doesn't allow a dot instead of a colon as separator for the chown
  parameters.
- Removed an accidental use of floating point code that prevented
  Angband from running on old machines without an FPU.
- Removed unnecessary event handlers that negativly affected performance.
- The "pseudo graphics" used by the (n)curses version didn't support
  terrain lightning correctly.
- The window resize control was sometimes overwritten with a black tile
  in the OS X version.
- Removed the warning message about missing preferences from the OS X
  version.  The first thing a new player sees after starting Angband
  shouldn't be a "scary" message.
- Added a Windows helpfile created by Jordan Hobbs.
- Added project files for building Angband with MS Visual C++ 7.1.
  (Tasha Jessup)

Changes in Angband 3.0.4:
- Made the water vortex immune to water-based attacks.
- Chaos resistance protects against confusion by chaos based attacks.
- Smoothed out the tables for extra mana-points per level, hitpoint
  bonus from constitution, "spells per level" vs. "spell stat", and
  INT/WIS dependent failure rate adjustment.  The old steps have been
  replaced by a steady increase, so small stat improvements are more
  useful.  Please note that this will also affect characters imported
  from older versions, so these might gain or lose some spells, mana,
  and hitpoints when imported into Angband 3.0.4.
- Gave the 'thanc daggers a 2d4 damage dice instead of 1d4 and made them
  more common. (Jonathan Ellis)
- Gave each of the Paur* gauntlets a single minor power (slow-digestion,
  regeneration, permanent light, feather fall) and made them more
  common. (Jonathan Ellis)
- Rods, wands, and staves with different charges can now be stacked.
  (based on the NPPAngband version that in turn is based on
  Leon Marrick's rod/wand stacking in OAngband.
- Rods can't be recharged anymore, but can be vulnerable to electricity.
- Rods of Recall, Perception, Curing, Healing, Restoration, and Speed
  will not be destroyed by electricity.
- Made Raal's Tome of Destruction more, and Kelek's Grimoire of Power
  less common. (Timo Pietilä)
- Heavy crossbows no longer can get the 'of the Haradrim' suffix and
  'light crossbows of the Haradrim' get a smaller damage bonus. (Timo
  Pietilä)
- Removed fire brand from ammo 'of Holy Might'. (Timo Pietilä)
- Give the short range teleport effect from gravity attacks on monsters
  an additional 1 in 3 chance to teleport the monster away.  This should
  make abusing the Rift spell a bit harder.
- Added a level dependent chance to resist the teleportation effect of
  gravity attacks for monsters and the player. (suggested by Jonathan
  Ellis)
- Junk items like broken sticks, empty bottles, and rodent skeletons are
  no longer generated in the dungeon.
- Removed the old haggling code.  The auto-haggling code is now
  permanently active and will give the normal price of items without the
  10% "sales tax".
- Replaced the old screendump code with HTML screendump code that
  handles graphics, bigscreen, bigtile, and other display oddities much
  better. (based on the htmldump-patch by Darkgod).
- Added support for artifact and ego-item descriptions. (with help from
  Hallvard B Furuseth)
- Added artifact descriptions.  The texts are mainly taken from OAngband
  and other variants. (Jonathan Ellis)
- Added object descriptions assembled by Hallvard B Furuseth.  The
  descriptions are mostly copied from obj-long.spo version 3.0.2 by Hugo
  Kornelis, Stephen S. Lee, Leonard Dickens and Craig Lewis.
- Added ego item descriptions for some ego types. (Hallvard B Furuseth)
- "Easy open" ignores broken doors now when trying to close doors.
- Added the equipment flag matrix to the character dump.
- Added new 8x8 tiles and tile definitions provided by "Dawnmist".
- Added the player's maximum depth in the dungeon to the character
  display and the dump.
- Removed several broken tile definitions for the 32x32 tiles.
- Use the proper monster flags instead of workarounds for various
  resists and immunities.  This also allows the reporting of these flags
  in the monster recall and the spoilers. (pointed out by Leon Marrick)
- You can now use either 'm' or 'p' to cast spells or pray.
- Allow direct melee attacks on visible monsters in walls.  You still
  have to tunnel into the wall if you are trying to attack an invisible
  monster. (suggested by Greg Stark)
- Show infos like "It cannot be harmed by the elements." when
  'Inspecting' books, just as for other item types.
- Changed the behavior of the 'auto_more' option, so that it
  automatically skips '-more-' prompts instead of not displaying
  messages on the top line. (Tom Houser)
- Changed the "Do you really want to quit?" prompt to "Do you really
  want to commit suicide?".
- Added a 'show scores' command to the knowledge menu.
- Changed the wording for the scores display a bit.
- Added the kill count of non-unique monsters to the knowledge menu.
- Added a modified version of Mogami's macro trigger patch. This patch
  modifies how macro trigger keys are displayed on screen and written in
  .prf files.  The trigger keys are no longer displayed in ugly key code
  style, such like ^__FFBE\r or ^_O_FF53\r, but in more smart style,
  such like \[F1] or \[alt-Right].
- Added a better character selection screen with support for using the
  cursor keys, display of info about the various race and class choices,
  and context sensitive help.  The code is based on the EyAngband's
  birth screen that again is probably based on ZAngband's birth screen.
- Select the sex, race, and class choices from a dead character as
  defaults for a new character.
- Added a stripped down version of Takeshi Mogami's "auto_dump" feature
  from Hengband.  Automatic pref file dumps from the game are now
  marked, so that they can be replaced when dumping to the same
  pref-file again.
- Allow the banishment spell to be aborted at the "Choose a monster race
  to banish" prompt without using up a scroll or charge.
- Added John Rauser's monster list patch that allows the user to display
  a list of the visible monsters in a window.
- Improved the navigation in the help files.
- Recharging wands or staves that have been fully *identified* before
  will now automatically reveal the new number of charges in the device.
  This fixes a bug where an already *ID'ed* wand or staff couldn't be
  *ID'ed* again after recharging (but plain ID works), despite the
  number of charges being unknown. (bug reported by Eddie Grove)
- text_to_ascii() didn't check that the characters used in \xAB
  sequences represent real hex characters.  Invalid hex sequences are
  now converted to the '?' character. (reported by Kieron Dunbar)
- Improved the handling of incomplete '\x' sequences in macros.  The old
  code could skip the final NUL-byte of the string if it ended with
  '\x', leading to a potential buffer overflow.
- Fixed a typo in the description of the "wild cat". (Jay McAbee)
- Monster groups ignored their fear when the smart_packs option was
  turned on. (reported by Eddie Grove)
- Rods and staves of probing are no longer automatically identified when
  used without a monster nearby. (reported by "someog")
- Prevent the player from being hit multiple times by area effect spells
  and breaths that can blink the player (nexus, gravity).
- The player can now get a level feeling when entering level 1 without
  spending 1000 game turns in town first. (Tom Houser)
- Branding ammo or weapons will now automatically try to combine and
  reorder the resulting objects, even if the enchantment of to-hit and
  to-dam fails. (reported by John D. Goulden)
- Try to output minor warning messages (such as "illegal option choice"
  when selecting a non existing item for a command) as soon as possible.
  (reported by "Mogami")
- Show all minor error messages immediately in the message window.
- The effects of light spells are only obvious if you aren't blind.
- Wands and rods of light don't give a message and aren't automatically
  identified when using them while blind. (reported by Steve Kroon)
- Refilling a latern from a stack of laterns will now only use the oil
  from one latern, not from the whole stack. (reported by Jay McAbee)
- Prevent earthquake/destruction spells from working in town.  This
  prevents inappropriate messages (like "The cave ceiling collapses!").
- Automatically try to load the "Kobold.prf" file at startup if the
  player is a Kobold.
- Improved the output of item and monster descriptions in spoilers and
  character dumps.  In some cases punctuation and spaces were wrapped to
  the next line.
- The basic object spoilers only reported the prices for unidentified
  items.  (reported by Hugo Kornelis)
- Only print the "You feel (less) resistant to ..." messages when not
  immune to the specific element. (reported by Jeff Greene)
- The cursor keys in the X11 ports behave the same way now, no matter if
  num-lock is on or off.
- Change colors in main-gcu.c. This is Dominik Grzelak's patch to change
  bright white from blue back to bright white. (Ed Cogburn)
- Added a workaround for a bug in the curses version with USE_GETCH.
  The news.txt screen was erased by the first call to the getch()
  function. (Frank Palazzolo)
- Angband consumed 100% of the cpu while waiting for a keypress in the
  GTK port. (Sheldon Simms)
- Allow text to be copied from the game window in the X11 port.
  (modified version of the code in Kieron Dunbar's sCthangband 1.0.10)
- Added transparency support to the 32x32 tiles in the Windows port.
  This requires a modified tiles bitmap and a new transparency mask
  originally created by Andrew Doull:
  ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Extra/graf-32x32-304.zip
- Removed the hackish 'Show scores' menu entry from the Windows version.
  Use the new knowledge menu entry instead.
- Applied lots of Mac specific patches by "pelpel".
- Allow initialization of the game to continue, even if the
  lib/data/*.raw files can't be written.  In that case the data parsed
  from the lib/edit/*.txt files stays in memory and is used instead of
  the *.raw data.  This currently wastes some memory, since the text
  arrays are not resized to the minimum required length.
- Added a performance tweak for the Angband Borg.
- Increased the data-type of the shopkeeper purse limit from signed
  16 bit to signed 32 bit.  This will allow shopkeepers with a higher
  limit than 32768 gold to be added.
- Added a compile time option to store the savefiles and scores in the
  player's home directory (under ~/.angband/Angband/) on multi-user
  machines.
- Use a different delay function in the DOS version that works around
  the restricted 55ms resolution on Windows 2000 and XP.

Changes in Angband 3.0.3:
- Reduced the size of the 32x32 tiles bitmap.  The smaller bitmap should
  fix the problem on older Windows versions (Windows 95 and 98) with
  restrictions of the maximal bitmap size .
  The tiles are available as a separate download from:
  ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Extra/graf-32x32-302.zip
- Fixed a bug in the text-output routines used for character dumps that
  sometimes introduced bogus output. (reported by Pasi Vartiainen)
- Fixed a wrong entry in the template for the X11 startup shell script.
  ("Mynstral")
- Fixed the display of *slays* in character dumps. (Matthias Kurzke)
- The "It might have hidden powers." message will now displayed in the
  character dumps.  This makes it easier to see if an artifact or ego-item
  with random abilities has already been *identified*.
- Curses on unidentified items are no longer revealed in character dumps or
  in the output of the 'Inspect' command.
- Fixed a typo - "intellegence". (Greg Stark)
- Updated the DOS version to compile with the latest version of the Allegro
  library.

Changes in Angband 3.0.2:
- Limited the maximum size of floor stacks to 23, so that get_item() can
  always display a list containing all objects.
- Renamed 'genocide' to 'banishment' and 'mass genocide' to 'mass
  banishment' since that name fits much better to the effect.  The priest's
  'banishment' spell has been renamed to 'banish evil' to avoid confusion
  and since that is what it actually does.
- Replaced silver arrows and bolts with mithril ammo since slay evil was
  too powerful.
- Changed the color of seeker bolts to green since there are so many 'light
  blue' ammo objects now.
- 'Golden staves' had the wrong color. (John I'anson-Holton)
- Improved indentation of the object descriptions in the character dump.
  (Andrew Sidwell)
- Destruction/Earthquake spells didn't properly destroy stacks of objects.
  After saving and loading the game, parts of the stacks were restored.
  (reported by Matthias Kurzke)
- Zapping a stack of recharging rods would instantly recharge all but one
  of them. (Tormod Haugen)
- Fixed an error in the LCC Makefile.
- Fixed an off-by-one error that prevented savefiles with the maximum
  number of monsters or objects from loading correctly. (Takeshi Mogami)
- Fixed an abuse that allowed the player to kill a monster with a ball
  spell by staying out of sight and detection range of the monster while
  the monster just patiently waited without ever getting a turn (reported
  by Tormod Haugen).  Wounded monsters will now always get their turn, even
  when out of range.
- The Elfstone 'Elessar' and the Jewel 'Evenstar' have the INSTA_ART flag
  now to make the APW-Borg happy.
- Amulets of resistance are now fully known after identifying one for the
  first time. (Dr. Andrew White)
- The option for flushing of pending input when failing to cast a spell
  didn't work.
- Fixed several bugs in the scorefile handling that could lead to
  duplicated entries for a single character. (reported by Hallvard Furuseth
  and Mauro Scarpa)
- Unified the code for object infos and artifact spoilers. (Andrew Sidwell)
- Added event-handler code to call Lua functions when things happen	in the
  game.
- Allow multiple Lua event handlers per event.
- Moved the generation of the player's fixed starting equipment (food and
  torches) to a Lua event handler.
- Which objects a store will buy and sell is now determined by a Lua
  script.
- Added various improvments to make finding errors in Lua code easier.
- The lib/edit/*.txt files can now optionally contain the names of the
  default object, monster, terrain, and flavor colors instead of just a
  character specifying the Angband color code.
- Changed the format of the flavor.txt file to make parsing easier.
- Allow the use of the Angband version number in conditional statements of
  the *.prf file format.
- Added Takeshi Mogami's bigtile patch that allows tile-graphics to have
  doubled width.
- Added support for David Gervais' 32x32 tileset to the Windows, X11, and
  XAW ports.  The tiles are available as a separate download from:
  ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Extra/32x32.zip
  (Takeshi Mogami)
- Improved the error message when a font can't be loaded in the X11 and
  XPJ frontends.
- Fixed a memory leak when switching between the various tilesets in the
  Windows version.

Changes in Angband 3.0.1:
- Added support for creating ego-item light-sources in ego_item.txt.
- Added bigscreen support to main-gcu.c. (pelpel)
- Check the panel-bounds more carefully to prevent problems when using
  a huge main window (heigher or wider than the dungeon).
- Added the missing error message for a vault that is too big.
- Applied the bugfixes from the new Lua 4.0.1 release. (Lua devteam)
- Added a boundary check to the macro adding code to prevent crashes
  when defining more than the maximum number of macros. (Eytan Zweig)
- Fixed various potential buffer overflows.
- Updated the Makefile for the lcc-win32 compiler and added compile
  instructions to compile.txt.
- Added x-spell.o and use-obj.o to various Makefiles and fixed some
  missing dependencies. (Hallvard B. Furuseth)
- my_strnicmp() in main-ros.c was quite buggy. (Hallvard B. Furuseth)
- The islower(), isupper(), ... and the tolower() and toupper()
  functions take an 'int' as the argument but actually expect it to be
  an 'unsigned char' or EOF.  We now cast the argument to 'unsigned
  char' to prevent breakage with 8-bit character data on hosts where
  'char' is signed.  (based on the patch by Hallvard B. Furuseth)
- Fixed an off-by-one error when checking if playing Angband is allowed
  at this time of day. (Hallvard B. Furuseth)
- Fixed the activation of 'The Shield of Deflection of Gil-galad'.
- Show the 'cursed' flag of artifacts in the spoilers. (KUSUNOSE Toru)
- Fixed a bug that allowed changes to the 'birth_no_stacking' birth-
  option to affect the current game. (KUSUNOSE Toru)

Changes in Angband 3.0:
- Added Jonathan Ellis' JLE patch that adds a new player race
  ("Kobold"), many new artifacts, vaults, monsters, objects, and
  ego-items; rebalances the gameplay; and adds a new color scheme for
  monsters.
- Added some new object flags ("kill demon", "kill undead"),
  activations, monster attacks ("cause halluzination") and monster
  spells/abilities (summon animal, throw boulder) for the JLE patch.
- Replaced the Mage, Rogue, and Ranger spell-lists with the spell-list
  from Greg Wooledge's GWAngband. This gives magic-users a much broader
  range of attack-spells to choose from including chaos, nether, sound,
  shards, and gravity effects.  Other big changes are the removal of
  the 'Globe of Invulnerability' and the addition of 'Rune of
  Protection'.
- ***** WARNING *****: All spells known by magic-users are discarded
  when importing an old savefile, so that the player can choose freely
  from the new spell-list.  Don't forget to relearn your spells before
  trying to use them.  Macros/keymaps with old spells probably won't
  work anymore - change them if necessary.
- Standing on a glyph no longer protects the player from melee
  attacks.
- Increased the range of infravision granted by potions of
  infravision to +5.
- Increased the damage of many wands and rods.
- The player can now reset the recall depth when recalling from a
  level above the deepest reached level.
- Adjusted the damage caps for various breath attacks. (JLE)
- Made the light radius cumulative.
- Added the Lua scripting language < http://www.lua.org/ > for easier
