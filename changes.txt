Angband 3.1.1
=============

This is an Angband development version -- it may be buggy, so be warned!

Cunningham, Chris Carr, Chris Robertson, Peter Denison, Joe Buck, Eric Osheim,
tigen, and rhinocesaurus.

Significant changes in this version:

The identify system, previously tweaked in 3.1.0, has been overhauled.  The game now allows you to identify items through use instead of using Identify scrolls; this means that you wield unknown items more often and use them for a while until their effects become obvious.  For example, wield an unknown sword and attack foes, and you will soon discover its combat advantages.  If you wear some armour and it increases your intelligence, the game will remember that.  And when you have discovered all of an item's attributes, that kind of item will be automatically known in future.  "Identify" is still in the game, but you will need to use it much less than before, and as a consequence, it is more expensive.  The game is more fun this way, trust me.

The second change that many will welcome is a reworked squelch system by Eddie Grove, which is quite similar to the one present in his patch of 3.0.9.  It allows squelching of more item types independently of each other, as well as squelching unaware consumables.

Another major change that most players will notice is the significantly different pricing that many items have.  This is because the algorithm that detemines item prices has changed a lot, and hopefully gives more reasonable prices than before, both because it makes things few would buy much cheaper and because it tries to price generally in proportion to usefulness.  This, combined with the two points above, means the emphasis of the game is much less on what you can lug back to stores to sell, and much more on exploration.
