Angband 3.0.9a
=============

Angband 3.0.9a is a bugfix version of 3.0.9.  It fixes the bug where
monsters act far too stupidly.  It also changes store UI behaviour so
that pressing Enter no longer initialises buying, but rather 'p' does.

This version also fixes a small bug with autoconf support.

Angband 3.0.9 had the following changelist:

Angband 3.0.9 is a bugfix version of 3.0.8, mostly.  Thanks go to the
many people who reported bugs, helped track them down, and especially
to those who provided patches.

 * Add 'K' command to "mark item kind as squelch".
 * Add squelch_worthless option; does what it says on the tin.
 * Fix use of an uninitialised variable.  (ctate)
 * Restore the "jump into trap and don't autopickup" command.  It
   doesn't "flip pickup" in the same way the old command did.
 * Always cast to (unsigned char) for the islower(), isdigit(), etc
   functions
 * Make graphics for flavoured items work properly in the object browser.
 * Fix command menu display in bigtile menu via something of a hack.
 * Display full monster picture in monster list in bigtile mode.
 * Fix obviously wrong code in main-gcu. (William McBrine)
 * Make disturb_panel work again (this is a 3.0.6 bug).
 * Add _GNU_SOURCE define to silence setresgid() errors. 
 * Give items that provide light descriptions in obj-info.c.
 * Describe the NO_FUEL flag.
 * Fix behaviour of the LITE flag.
 * Collect Banishment effects into one big lump sum.  Death now comes
   quickly.
 * Use better spell and object descriptions.  (Hugo Kornelis)
 * Added <click> or 'g' to some prompts where they are now acceptable
   inputs.
 * Fix acid damage of objects to make it a chance rather than a certainty.
 * Don't count hidden squelchable objects when deciding where to place
   things in monster drops (or whatever).  This should stop drops from
   killing a monster appearing miles away from that monster with
   nothing appearing in between.
 * Make 'Glyph of Warding' 'shove' items out of the way when created on
   a spot.
 * Fix bug in removal of autoinscriptions
 * "!d" stops squelch auto-dropping things, and "!k" marks an object
   not to be squelched.
 * (Windows) Open windows in reverse order so the Term 5 is behind
   Term 4 is behind Term 3 and so on.
 * (GTK) Remember user preferences.
 * Miscellaneous small things reported by Hugo Kornelis.
   (for more info, see <http://dev.rephial.org/trac/ticket/252>)
 * Rewrite description of birth_no_preserve to make it even less
   ambiguous.
 * Allow use of objects from the floor when blind.
 * Reset text indent after squelch help.  This means monster recall no
   longer gets 1-char indents from the side of the screen.
 * (Linux only) Always enter stores when moving onto them.
 * Only mark things as squelchable if we know the 'flavour' through ID
   or whatever.
 * Fixed object detection behaviour w.r.t the hide_squelchable option.
 * Add 'link' to the high score table from knowledge menu.
 * Mark starting equipment as 'everseen' for squelching & object
   knowledge purposes.
 * Add missing entries in the monster knowledge list.
 * Tidied up the knowledge screens, so that recalled text is always at
   the top of the screen, and stop giving artifact spoilers.
 * Report the right number of items in your inventory after a store
   transaction.
 * Stop superfluous '-more-'s in the shops.
 * Avoid possible out-of-bounds array access if you're clev50 when when
   entering the store.
 * Rearrange object knowledge menu, so flavoured items come first.
 * Make EAT_LITE monsters eat light again.
 * Show resist blindness properly in self knowledge displays.
 * Let 'h' work in stores with the roguelike keyset.
 * Removed the x11 "keycode translations" (i.e. rewriting "^_]3244"
   type sequences to "\[PgUp]" type sequences)  for '-' and '=' from
   the pref files to prevent x11's automatic macros from breaking
   those keys.  This was most often manifested when trying to use items
   on the floor.
 * Fixed bug in "Interact with macros" menu where the echoing of macros
   as you typed them would be messed up if any "keycode translations"
   took place.

Autoconf
--------
Please use gmake on BSDs.  It should work OK.

 * Install all files properly.
 * Expand DEFAULT_PATH correctly.
 * Remember to include X11 paths.
 * Chown the angband executable when appropriate.
 * Fix SDL sound support.
 * Fix the "cannot find .depend" error.
