Angband 4.0.0
=============

Please note that no 3.x characters, living or dead, will move gracefully into this version.  Finish off your character in your current version before moving over.

In the normal course of events, this file would contain details of every change that has been made since the previous version.  This version is a special case.  There are no gameplay changes, or at least only small details.  There are, however, massive changes to the code base.  The intent is to make the game more modifiable and flexible, and to prepare for big gameplay changes to come.

Summary of Changes
------------------
Core-UI split
 - split the game into core and UI, and stop anything in the core from depending on anything in the UI

Modifiability
 - put many of the game constants in a text file rather than being compiled in, so they are user alterable
 - text data files cleaned up and documented
 - help file for modifying added - lib/help/modifying.txt

Dungeon generation
 - allow saving of dungeon levels and the town
 - allow generation of dungeon levels piece by piece
 - generalise level generation algorithms
 - allow more control over monster generation for thematic purposes
 - allow regions where restrictions apply (eg no ESP or no mapping)
 - there is a 'squares' array containing the terrain, locality info, traps, objects, flow info and monster on each grid

Player knowledge
 - duplicate the dungeon level "cave" struct, so that there is a reality version and a player version

Objects
 - replace pvals (aside from fuel, food etc) by an array of values
 - separate resistances, immunities etc from flags to allow for more values of resistance
 - separate brands and slays from flags to allow more variablilty
 - remove hard-coding of object tvals and svals, so objects can be safely added and moved around in object.txt
 - handle special artifacts straight from artifact.txt, so an unrecognised object kind (like Phial) automatically has a new object kind defined for it
 - put artifact activations in a text file
 - put objects in linked lists tied to the grid, store, monster or player that holds them, rather than indexed in a level-wide list

Inventory, quiver, equipment
 - make ordering of the inventory and quiver a UI construct only
 - use a Poschengband-style equipment template to specify equipment slots (so there is a standard player body, but more could be added)

Monster memory
 - make this a separate file, with full memory obtainable by copying monster.txt

Terrain/traps
 - multiple gameplay-identical terrain types now handled by temporary flags during generation
 - a full terrain flag system to allow easier addition/removal of terrain types
 - make traps separate entities, not terrain
 - make locked/jammed doors just closed doors with a trap
 - remove code reliance on the numerical value of terrain types

Squelch->Ignoring
 - remove all references to 'squelch', replace with 'ignore'
 - add ignore by ego type
 - emphasise the philosophy that the items are still there, just ignored

ID
 - have a separate field for every learnable property of an item
 - remove the IDENT_* flags

Effects
 - have all effects performed by a single function, and definable from text files

Monster attacks
 - put elemental spell effects back in the projection code rather than the spellcasting code
 - put blow effects into seprate handler functions

Player spells
 - generalise to make it easier to introduce new realms, classes, etc
 - have all spell info defined by a text data file

Projection
 - have separate functions to handle effects on terrain, objects, player, monsters
 - clarify different types of projection
 - allow for cone-shaped breaths
 - allow for a wider variety of effects (eg player/monsters pushed by force)

Stats, power, etc
 - refine and generalise stats where possible
 - attempt to clarify all the (frankly) fudge factors so they can more easily be seen and adjusted

General code stuff
 - rename files to be more sensible, or create new ones where needed
 - update debug commands to reflect the current game
 - move data into list-*.h files or edit files where appropriate
 - remove archaic stuff
 - re-organisation of lib directory
 - document!
