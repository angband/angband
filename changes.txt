Changes in Angband 3.0.3:
- Reduced the size of the 32x32 tiles bitmap.  The smaller bitmap should
  fix the problem on older Windows versions (Windows 95 and 98) with
  restrictions of the maximal bitmap size .
  The tiles are available as a separate download from:
  ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Extra/graf-32x32-302.zip
- Fixed a bug in the text-output routines used for character dumps that
  sometimes introduced bogus output. (reported by Pasi Vartiainen)
- Fixed a wrong entry in the template for the X11 startup shell script.
  ("Mynstral")
- Fixed the display of *slays* in character dumps. (Matthias Kurzke)
- The "It might have hidden powers." message will now displayed in the
  character dumps.  This makes it easier to see if an artifact or ego-item
  with random abilities has already been *identified*.
- Curses on unidentified items are no longer revealed in character dumps or
  in the output of the 'Inspect' command.
- Fixed a typo - "intellegence". (Greg Stark)
- Updated the DOS version to compile with the latest version of the Allegro
  library.

Changes in Angband 3.0.2:
- Limited the maximum size of floor stacks to 23, so that get_item() can
  always display a list containing all objects.
- Renamed 'genocide' to 'banishment' and 'mass genocide' to 'mass
  banishment' since that name fits much better to the effect.  The priest's
  'banishment' spell has been renamed to 'banish evil' to avoid confusion
  and since that is what it actually does.
- Replaced silver arrows and bolts with mithril ammo since slay evil was
  too powerful.
- Changed the color of seeker bolts to green since there are so many 'light
  blue' ammo objects now.
- 'Golden staves' had the wrong color. (John I'anson-Holton)
- Improved indentation of the object descriptions in the character dump.
  (Andrew Sidwell)
- Destruction/Earthquake spells didn't properly destroy stacks of objects.
  After saving and loading the game, parts of the stacks were restored.
  (reported by Matthias Kurzke)
- Zapping a stack of recharging rods would instantly recharge all but one
  of them. (Tormod Haugen)
- Fixed an error in the LCC Makefile.
- Fixed an off-by-one error that prevented savefiles with the maximum
  number of monsters or objects from loading correctly. (Takeshi Mogami)
- Fixed an abuse that allowed the player to kill a monster with a ball
  spell by staying out of sight and detection range of the monster while
  the monster just patiently waited without ever getting a turn (reported
  by Tormod Haugen).  Wounded monsters will now always get their turn, even
  when out of range.
- The Elfstone 'Elessar' and the Jewel 'Evenstar' have the INSTA_ART flag
  now to make the APW-Borg happy.
- Amulets of resistance are now fully known after identifying one for the
  first time. (Dr. Andrew White)
- The option for flushing of pending input when failing to cast a spell
  didn't work.
- Fixed several bugs in the scorefile handling that could lead to
  duplicated entries for a single character. (reported by Hallvard Furuseth
  and Mauro Scarpa)
- Unified the code for object infos and artifact spoilers. (Andrew Sidwell)
- Added event-handler code to call Lua functions when things happen	in the
  game.
- Allow multiple Lua event handlers per event.
- Moved the generation of the player's fixed starting equipment (food and
  torches) to a Lua event handler.
- Which objects a store will buy and sell is now determined by a Lua
  script.
- Added various improvments to make finding errors in Lua code easier.
- The lib/edit/*.txt files can now optionally contain the names of the
  default object, monster, terrain, and flavor colors instead of just a
  character specifying the Angband color code.
- Changed the format of the flavor.txt file to make parsing easier.
- Allow the use of the Angband version number in conditional statements of
  the *.prf file format.
- Added Takeshi Mogami's bigtile patch that allows tile-graphics to have
  doubled width.
- Added support for David Gervais' 32x32 tileset to the Windows, X11, and
  XAW ports.  The tiles are available as a separate download from:
  ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Extra/32x32.zip
  (Takeshi Mogami)
- Improved the error message when a font can't be loaded in the X11 and
  XPJ frontends.

  a huge main window (heigher or wider than the dungeon).
- Added the missing error message for a vault that is too big.
- Applied the bugfixes from the new Lua 4.0.1 release. (Lua devteam)
- Added a boundary check to the macro adding code to prevent crashes
  when defining more than the maximum number of macros. (Eytan Zweig)

- Updated the Makefile for the lcc-win32 compiler and added compile
  instructions to compile.txt.
- Added x-spell.o and use-obj.o to various Makefiles and fixed some
  missing dependencies. (Hallvard B. Furuseth)
- my_strnicmp() in main-ros.c was quite buggy. (Hallvard B. Furuseth)
- The islower(), isupper(), ... and the tolower() and toupper()
  functions take an 'int' as the argument but actually expect it to be
  an 'unsigned char' or EOF.  We now cast the argument to 'unsigned
  char' to prevent breakage with 8-bit character data on hosts where
  'char' is signed.  (based on the patch by Hallvard B. Furuseth)
- Fixed an off-by-one error when checking if playing Angband is allowed
  at this time of day. (Hallvard B. Furuseth)
- Fixed the activation of 'The Shield of Deflection of Gil-galad'.
- Show the 'cursed' flag of artifacts in the spoilers. (KUSUNOSE Toru)
- Fixed a bug that allowed changes to the 'birth_no_stacking' birth-
  option to affect the current game. (KUSUNOSE Toru)

- Added Jonathan Ellis' JLE patch that adds a new player race
  ("Kobold"), many new artifacts, vaults, monsters, objects, and
  ego-items; rebalances the gameplay; and adds a new color scheme for
  monsters.
- Added some new object flags ("kill demon", "kill undead"),
  activations, monster attacks ("cause halluzination") and monster
  spells/abilities (summon animal, throw boulder) for the JLE patch.
- Replaced the Mage, Rogue, and Ranger spell-lists with the spell-list
  from Greg Wooledge's GWAngband. This gives magic-users a much broader
  range of attack-spells to choose from including chaos, nether, sound,
  shards, and gravity effects.  Other big changes are the removal of
  the 'Globe of Invulnerability' and the addition of 'Rune of
  Protection'.
- ***** WARNING *****: All spells known by magic-users are discarded
  when importing an old savefile, so that the player can choose freely
  from the new spell-list.  Don't forget to relearn your spells before
  trying to use them.  Macros/keymaps with old spells probably won't
  work anymore - change them if necessary.
- Standing on a glyph no longer protects the player from melee
  attacks.
- Increased the range of infravision granted by potions of
  infravision to +5.

  level above the deepest reached level.

- Made the light radius cumulative.
- Added the Lua scripting language < http://www.lua.org/ > for easier
  customization.  Currently the scripts handle the effects of using
  objects such as staves, wands, rods, potions, scrolls, food, and
  activatable objects.  The player-spells are also defined in a script.
- Added support for object descriptions that are displayed when
  examining objects.
- Moved the item flavors into an external file and added *.prf files
  for the flavors.

  to the main screen.
- Various prompts at player birth use 'Enter' instead of 'ESC' now.
- Added a no-item-stacking-on-floor birth-option.

  the town will be regenerated when loading an old savefile, so don't
  leave any objects on the floor when you upgrade your savefile!
- Added support for a hitpoint-warning sound effect.
- You can now browse books in the stores.
- Reorganized and cleaned up the list of options.
- The known uniques list is now separated into two columns to make it
  easier to read. One column for the names and one for the
  "is dead/alive" text.
- Allowed examining multiple items without having to return to the
  tombstone screen.
- Added an option to review messages to the tombstone.
- Changed the keys to view high scores from 't' to 'v' and allowed
  upper case for each of the options in the tombstone screen.
- Added color to the monster recall.
- Allowed using the roguelike keyset to navigate in the options screen.
- Savefiles from pre-2.9.0 versions are no longer accepted.

  sounds. (Werner Baer)
- Executables build with configure under Cygwin no longer require the
  Cygwin DLL.
- Added the latest Amiga code (Bablos).
- Fixed a possible crash when searching disarmed chests for traps.
- Monsters draining large stacks of wands or staffs could get negative
  hitpoints due to the overflow of a signed 16 bit variable.
- Fixed the problems with the 'repeat command' command.
- Bounds-checking for detection spells and some wizard mode commands
  was missing.  That could cause crashs when resizing the Terms.
- 'Interact with visuals' could display negative char numbers.
- Don't partially repair blasted equipment when loading the savefile.
- Fixed a bug that caused an infinite loop in the RNG when the u32b
  type has more than 32 bits.
- The confirmation for wizard mode was required every time wizard mode
  was switched on.
- Vaults could sometimes have up to 9 times the requested number of
  monsters.

- The Windows version no longer requires changes to angband.ini when
  installing.  The angband.ini file will be created when you first start
  the program, so it doesn't need to be present in the binary archive.
  That also allows easy updates to newer versions, since the settings
  in the angband.ini are not overwritten when installing a new version
  over an old one.
- The windows can be resized and the (graphical) tiles will adjust
  automatically to the new size.
- Added the "Show scores" command to the menu.
- Fixed a bug that created all files as "read-only" (causing the game to
  fail when saving the game).
- Fixed a bug that caused all numbers to be registered twice by the game,
  leading to "double-steps".
- Fixed a bug that didn't free the used bitmaps correctly when closing
  the game.

DOS-specific changes:
- Graphics, sounds, and music options
  You can switch the graphics/music/sound options from the user menu
  (press ! to get there).  The volume of the sound and the music can be
  adjusted from 0 (min) to 255 (max).  All changes to the screen-resolution
  and the selection between the old and the new graphical tiles will be
  active after you restart Angband.
- Terminal windows
  The windows can be activated from the "Angband options screen"
  (press the '=' key to get there) in the "Window flags" menu.
  Just toggle the display you want for "Term-1" and "Term-2".
- Added a stone-background to the terminals.
- Midi jukebox
  DOS-Angband automatically plays midi-files from the "lib/xtra/music"
  folder in your Angband-directory.
- Sound Events
  DOS-Angband will play samples from the "lib/xtra/sound" folder to the
  corresponding Angband-event. You can configure the available samples in
  the "lib/xtra/sound/sound.cfg" file.  Multiple sounds per event are
  supported.
- "Classic mode": If you want the old display, just start Angband with the
  '-mibm' option ('Angband.exe -mibm').
