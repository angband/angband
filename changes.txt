  in the angband.ini are not overwritten when installing a new version
  over an old one.

  automatically to the new size.
- Added the "Show scores" command to the menu.

  the game.

  You can switch the graphics/music/sound options from the user menu
  (press ! to get there).  The volume of the sound and the music can be
  adjusted from 0 (min) to 255 (max).  All changes to the screen-resolution
  and the selection between the old and the new graphical tiles will be
  active after you restart Angband.
- Terminal windows
  The windows can be activated from the "Angband options screen"
  (press the '=' key to get there) in the "Window flags" menu.
  Just toggle the display you want for "Term-1" and "Term-2".
- Added a stone-background to the terminals.
- Midi jukebox
  DOS-Angband automatically plays midi-files from the "lib/xtra/music"
  folder in your Angband-directory.
- Sound Events
  DOS-Angband will play samples from the "lib/xtra/sound" folder to the
  corresponding Angband-event. You can configure the available samples in
  the "lib/xtra/sound/sound.cfg" file.  Multiple sounds per event are
  supported.
- "Classic mode": If you want the old display, just start Angband with the
  '-mibm' option ('Angband.exe -mibm').
