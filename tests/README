elly/angband end-to-end tests

This directory contains the end-to-end tests. The important script here is
run-test, which runs angband with -mtest, feeds it some input, and compares the
output against the expected output.

Layout of a test:
/tests/$suite/$test:
	/input: Input to supply to the test frontend.
	/output: Expected output from the test.
	/matcher: Optional; an arbitrary program to match input against output;
	          will be run instead of diff(1).
	/run.out: Optional; output from last run of this test.

For examples, look in /tests/trivial.
