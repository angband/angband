News:
  Take note:  Priests (and Paladins) now need spellbook to learn spells.
        This was done to keep the spells in the deeper books special.
Bugs:
        "probing" sometimes completely ignores a monster...  This may be
          related to the "monster heal bug" (which has been patched over,
          not truly fixed), but I don't know.
