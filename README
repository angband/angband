   The source files are in .\src.  .\other contains all the files packaged
with the executable, except for the 'angband.exe' file.

   To compile, check the makefile, 'makefile.tc', and the linkfile,
'tclink.lnk', to verify that the paths are set correctly for your system.
Then cd to the .\src directory, and 'make -fmakefile.tc angband' should
start the compile.  Any warning messages produced during the compile can
safely be ignored.  For fastest compiling, it helps to have both a disk
cache, and EMS/XMS memory available for Turbo C to use.

	Share and Enjoy,
