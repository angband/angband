Angband 2.6.2 version 4 for the Macintosh.This is version 4 of Angband 2.6.2 for the Macintosh.  It should run onany 68000 with System 6.0.1? or higher OS.It is savefile-compatible with all other 2.6.2's on all other platforms.Remember to use BINARY when ftping!  This will also work with savefiles fromMacAngband 2.5.8 and 2.6.1.  (But 2.5.8 won't work with savefiles from 2.6.1or 2.6.2!)You can add fonts and sizes to the font and size menu using ResEdit.  Be sure thefonts you add are fixed width fonts.  A list of fonts available on your systemcan be obtained by looking at the Key Caps menu.Please let me know if you encounter a bug, and try to describe it so that I canreproduce it (mail me a binhex'd copy of your savefile if that will help).  Also,any comments or suggestions you have will be greatly appreciated.Send any comments, suggestions, and bugs to:  Keith H.

MacAngband will ask you to locate the   lib directory manually if this occurs.  If this doesn't work, try putting   the lib directory in your root directory.- level feelings are not saved.- use new screen layout option doesn't do anything.
