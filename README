elly/angband

This is a loose branch of the vanilla Angband tree, and tracks the Vanilla tree
as closely as possible. The purpose of this tree is to do incremental
refactoring to make unit-testing easier, as well as adding said unit tests to
the game. As such, the important deltas from the Vanilla tree are:

- End-to-end tests. These are driven by /run-tests; see /tests/README for more
  information about these. These also have a driver program, called
  /src/main-test.c.
- Unit tests. These are driven by /src/Makefile and /src/tests/run-tests; see
  /src/tests/README for more information.
- Refactoring. At any given time, some refactorings in this tree will probably
  not be integrated into Vanilla.

Note the following special rule for commits into this tree: It is forbidden for
a new commit to reduce the number of passing unit tests. It is okay to add a
failing unit test for something that you are working on, since we currently have
almost no test coverage; as coverage gets better, it will become forbidden for a
new commit to cause any unit tests, including newly-added ones, to fail.
Furthermore, any bug fix into this tree will ideally come with a new unit test
to trap that particular bug, although that will not be possible until coverage
improves.

Areas of work:
Currently, I am working on the birth and data-file initialization code, since
they are both relatively easy areas to begin unravelling the ball of string in.
Check my commit log for more details.
