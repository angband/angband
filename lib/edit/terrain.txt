# File: terrain.txt


# This file is used to initialize the "terrain feature" information for 
# the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# Note that, unlike other edit files, modifying this file casually is likely
# to be a BAD IDEA (unless you intend to make actual programming changes)
# for two reasons:

#   1. Terrain features do not appear unless there is specific code in the
#   level generation algorithms to include them, so adding new terrain
#   features to this file will by itself have no effect.

#   2. The game uses the names of the standard terrain features
#   ("granite wall", etc) in terrain placement.  Changing the name of a terrain
#   feature can thus stop the game from running; changing its properties will
#   change game behaviour; and any changes during the playing of an individual
#   game are likely to mess it up.

# Note that terrain feature zero contains the "darkness" picture.

# === Understanding terrain.txt ===

# name : serial number : terrain name
# graphics : symbol : color
# mimic : feature to mimic
# priority : display priority on mini-map
# flags : terrain flags
# info : shop number : digging

# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new feature.

# 'graphics' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 27 colors:

# D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Umber
# W - Light Gray   P - Light Purple   y - Yellow        R - Light Red
# G - Light Green  B - Light Blue     U - Light Umber   p - Purple
# v - Violet       t - Teal           m - Mud           Y - Light Yellow
# i - Magenta-Pink T - Light Teal     V - Light Violet  I - Light Pink
# M - Mustard      z - Blue Slate     Z - Deep Light Blue

# 'mimic' is the index of a feature to mimic; some features look like another
# feature until they are discovered by the player.

# 'priority' is for display priority on the minimap, where only a selection
# of grids are chosen.  This enables the minimap to display the information
# most likely to be useful to the player.

# 'flags' is for terrain flags.

# 'info' is for other terrain information;  Shop number is the index of the
# shop if the terrain is a shop entrance, and 0 otherwise.  Digging is an
# index used to get the difficulty of digging through this type of terrain.
