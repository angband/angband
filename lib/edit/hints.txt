H:If you have more than 99 items in your quiver, it will take up more slots.
H:Many items are bad, but few are cursed to the point of needing magic.

H:Under great weights of loot, you'll be less quick of foot.
H:You're never invicible. Never forget that.
H:Always carry around an escape that you can use while blind and confused.
H:Staying on a level too long can cause awake random monsters to spawn.
H:Wands and staves sell for a good price even with 0 charges.
