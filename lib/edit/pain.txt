# This file is used to initialize the monster pain messages for Angband.

# === Understanding pain.txt ===

# N: serial number
# M: message
# M: message
# etc.

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item.

# 'M' is for the pain message. Each entry must have 7 messages --
# each one corresponds to a range of health, with higher messages 
# being displayed when a monster is damaged only a little, and lower
# messages being displayed when a monster is near death.
