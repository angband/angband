# N % chance of having an item.

# pit will be one of the specified colors. You may use any number of 'C' lines.
#
# 'T' is for monster template (see monster_base.txt). Up to 4 'T' lines may be present.
# If there are no 'T' lines, then monsters may have any monster template. Otherwise,
# every monster in this pit/nest will be one of the listed templates.
#
# 'F' is for monster flags. Every monster in this pit/nest will have every listed flag.
# As many 'F' lines as are necessary may be used.
#

# As many 'f' lines as are necessary may be used.
