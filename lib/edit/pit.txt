# File: pit.txt

# This file is used to initialize the "monster nest/pit" information for Angband.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing, unless
# you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# If you add more pits to the file, make sure to update limits.txt.

# N: serial number : name
# R: room type
# A: rarity : average level
# O: object rarity
# T: template name
# T: template name
# F: flag | flag | ...
# S: spell | spell | ...
# s: forbidden spell | ...
#
# Each entry must start with an 'N' line, with a new serial number,
# and a name.
#
# 'R' is for room type. Currently, room type is one of the following:
#   (1) Pits (large room filled with many monsters of a few types in an ordered fashion)
#   (2) Nests (large room filled with many types of monsters in a disordered fashion)
#
# 'A' is for rarity and average level. A rarity of N means that the pit is N times
# more rare than a pit with a rarity of 1. The average level is the dungeon level
# at which this pit is most common.
#
# 'O' is for object rarity. A rarity of N means that every square of the pit has a
# 1 in N chance of having an item.
#
# 'T' is for monster template (see monster_base.txt). Up to 4 'T' lines may be present.
# If there are no 'T' lines, then monsters may have any monster template. Otherwise,
# every monster in this pit/nest will be one of the listed templates.
#
# 'F' is for monster flags. Every monster in this pit/nest will have every listed flag.
# As many 'F' lines as are necessary may be used.
#
# 'S' is for spell flags. Every monster in this nest/pit will have every listed spell flag.
# As many 'S' lines as are necessary may be used.
#
# 's' is for forbidden spell flags. No monster in this nest/pit will have any of the listed
# spell flags. As many 's' lines as are necessary may be used.
