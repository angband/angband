# File: artifact.txt


# This file is used to initialize the "artifact" information for Angband.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# The artifact indexes are defined in "defines.h", and must not be changed.

# Hack -- "Grond" and "Morgoth" MUST have a rarity of one, or they might
# not be dropped when Morgoth is killed.  Note that they, like the "special"
# artifacts, are never created "accidentally".

# === Understanding artifact.txt ===

# N: serial number : item name
# I: tval : sval
# W: depth : rarity : weight : cost
# A: allocation probability : min depth : max depth
# P: base armor class : base damage : plus to-hit : plus to-dam : plus to-ac
# F: flag | flag | etc
# E: activation effect : recharge time
# M: message when activated
# L: pval : flag | flag | etc.
# D: description

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item.

# 'I' is for basic information. The tval is for the type of item, the
# sval identifies the subtype.

# 'W' is for extra information. Depth and rarity are not currently used,
# weight is in tenth-pounds and cost is the item's value.

# 'A' is for allocation details. alloc_prob is the % chance of the artifact
# being generated, min depth is the earliest it is normally found, max
# depth is the deepest it is ever found.

# 'P' is for power information. The items base armor class, its base
# damage and pluses to-hit, to-dam and to-ac.

# 'F' is for flags not associated with any pval. These are fairly 
# self-explanatory. As many F: lines may be used as are needed to 
# specify all the flags and flags are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'E' is for effect. The activation is the effect the artifact
# activates for. The recharge time calculates from the recharge time
# plus a random value between 1 and the recharge time dice (if not 0).

# 'M' is for the activation message text.

# 'L' is for pval and flags specific to that pval. Each pval and its flags
# need a line to themselves. MAX_PVALS is defined in src/defines.h - you
# will need to recompile if you wish to change this value. A pval can
# take a random value.

# 'D' is for the artifact description.  These appear when the item is 
# identified.  Special thanks to J.R.R Tolkien, without whom the words would
# be unwritten, the images unconceived, the deed undone. -LM-

### IMPORTANT NOTES ###
# (1.) Any changes or additions to the file will have influence on randarts
# and may break savefile compatibility for old savegames with randarts.  If
# using random artifacts, finish your existing game before making any
# changes to the artifact.txt file at all.
# (2.) Removing any artifact, or changing its "base" type (as defined by
# the tval and sval entries in the "I:" line), will break savefile
# compatibility for ALL savefiles.
# (3.) Adding a new artifact, or changing the powers of existing ones, will
# NOT affect savefile compatibility for games with the standard artifact set:
# it is perfectly safe to do this. (If your new artifact is a new kind of
# object, or a new one at the end of the file, you must also amend object.txt
# or limits.txt.)
