# name: name: short description
# graphics: ASCII char used to represent the feature: color symbol
# appear: rarity: minimum depth: maximum number on level
# visibility: player trap visibility value
# desc: description

# flags: trap flags
#    These include:
#    - DOWN: after running effects, drops the player down a dungeon level
#    - ONEITME: after running effects, trap disappears
#    - MAGICAL: uses the magic disarm skill - other traps use physical disarm
#    - VISIBLE: trap will not be hidden when generated
#    - FLOOR: * can be set on the floor
#    - TRAP: * is a trap
#
#    Flags marked '*' must be set for a trap to be generated as part of
#    normal dungeon generation.
#
#    See list-trap-flags.h for a full list.

# msg: activation message
#    This is shown to the user when the trap is triggered.

# save: object flags that provide a saving throw
# msg-good: save message
# msg-bad: fail to save message
#    There are two ways to give the player a chance of avoiding the trap:
#
#    1. If the 'save' line is provided, then if player has the flags
#       specified on the 'save' line, the trap is avoided, and/or
#    2. If the 'msg-bad' line is provided, then a roll is made against the
#       player's AC, which if successful avoids the trap.
#
#    If the trap is avoided, the 'msg-good' line is printed instead.  If it
#    isn't, 'msg-bad' is printed.

# effect: trap effect : ? subtype : ? radius : ? extra parameter
# dice: dice string for effect
# expr: dice expression for effect
#    If there is no saving throw, or it fails, then these effects are
#    triggered.

# msg-xtra: extra effect message
# effect-xtra: extra effect : ? subtype : ? radius : ? extra parameter
# dice-xtra: dice string for extra effect
# expr-xtra: dice expression for extra effect
#    If there is no saving throw, or it fails, then these effects are
#    also triggered 50% of the time.  If they are triggered, the 'msg-xtra'
#    line is printed, if present.
