# blow:blow verb

# 'name' is the name of the shape.

# 'combat' is for modifiers to hit, to damage and to armor class.

# 'skill-<skill name>' is for modifications to player skills - physical
# and magical disarming, saving throws, stealth, searching, to hit (normal), 
# to hit (throwing), digging.

# 'obj-flags' is for object flags (as in src/list-obj-flags.h) gained
# from the shapechange.

# 'play-flags' is for player flags (as in src/list-player-flags.h) gained
# from the shapechange.

# 'values' is for resistances and modifiers gained from the shapechange.

# 'effect' defines any effect which happens on taking the new shape,
# and optionally parameters for effect subtype, effect radius and
# an extra parameter for various things

# 'dice' provides a random value to be used by an effect (for damage,
# healing, etc).  As well as the normal random value fields described above,
# it can contain expressions like $B, which refer forward to an 'expr' line.

# 'expr' provides an expression for use in effect dice.  It consists of a
# code letter (eg B) for the expression, a base function to use (for example
# PLAYER_LEVEL), and a sequence of operations to perform on that base.

# 'effect-msg' provides a message which can be used in whatever way the effect
# needs, typically to print during the effect, or as a death message.

# 'blow' is for verbs for how the shapechanged character will hit monsters.
# Frequencies can be adjusted by having more than one line the same.
