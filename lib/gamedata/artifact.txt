# This file is used to initialize the "artifact" information for Angband.

# === Understanding artifact.txt ===

# name: serial number : item name
# base-object: tval : sval
# graphics: symbol : color
# info: level : weight : cost
# alloc: allocation probability : min depth : max depth
# power: base armor class : base damage : plus to-hit : plus to-dam : plus to-ac
# flags: flag | flag | etc
# act: activation
# time : recharge time
# msg: message when activated
# values: label[value] | label[value] | etc.
# desc: description

# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item.

# 'base-object' is for base object type. The tval is for the type of item, the
# sval identifies the subtype.  If the sval is not a standard object kind
# as defined in object.txt, the game will generate a special object kind,
# and these are known as 'special artifacts'.

# 'graphics' is for symbol and color. It is needed for special artifacts.

# 'info' is for information. Level indicates difficulty of any activation,
# weight is in tenth-pounds and cost is the item's value.

# 'alloc' is for allocation details. alloc_prob is the % chance of the artifact
# being generated, min depth is the earliest it is normally found, max
# depth is the deepest it is ever found.

# 'power' is for power information. The items base armor class, its base
# damage and pluses to-hit, to-dam and to-ac.

# 'flags' is for object flags as listed in list-object-flags.h. These are
# fairly self-explanatory. As many flags: lines may be used as are needed to 
# specify all the flags and flags are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'act' is for activation. The activation is the effect the artifact
# activates for.

# 'time' is for recharge time. The recharge time calculates from the recharge
# time plus a random value between 1 and the recharge time dice (if not 0).

# 'msg' is for activation message text, if different from the regular effect
# message.

# 'value' is for properties that take a value and a random expression for that
# value. Valid properties are object modifiers (as found in list-stats.h and
# list-object-modifiers.h), brands (based on the first 5 entries from
# list-elements.h), slays (based on racial monster flags in
# list-mon-race-flags.h or monster bases in monster_base.txt) and resistances
# (based on list-elements.h).

# 'desc' is for the artifact description.  These appear when the item is 
# identified.  Special thanks to J.R.R Tolkien, without whom the words would
# be unwritten, the images unconceived, the deed undone. -LM-

### IMPORTANT NOTES ###
# (1.) Any changes or additions to the file will have influence on randarts
# and may break savefile compatibility for old savegames with randarts.  If
# using random artifacts, finish your existing game before making any
# changes to the artifact.txt file at all.
# (2.) Removing any artifact, or changing its "base" type (as defined by
# the tval and sval entries in the "base-object:" line), will break savefile
# compatibility for ALL savefiles.
# (3.) Adding a new artifact, or changing the powers of existing ones, will
# NOT affect savefile compatibility for games with the standard artifact set:
# it is perfectly safe to do this.
