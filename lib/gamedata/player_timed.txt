# File: player_timed.txt
# Used in conjunction with list-player-timed.h
# Timed player properties
#
# Descriptions, messages and message types can be edited without bad effects.
# Changing code or fail may have unpredictable results.
# Changing the name, reordering, or adding whole new entires will severely
# disrupt the game, and should only be done when list-player-timed.h
# (and other code) is also  being changed, and the game recompiled.
#
# Fields:
# name - the effect name
# desc - the effect description
# grade - the message on increasing a grade of the effect.  Note that most
#         effects only have two grades (on and off); for these, the message
#         is just the message on beginning the effect
# on-end - the message on ending the effect
# on-increase - the message on the effect increasing
# on-decrease - the message on the effect decreasing
# msgt - the message type for this effect
# fail - determines what makes the effect fail.
#        param one:
#          1 - object flag
#          2 - resist
#          3 - vulnerability
#          4 - player flag
#        param two:
#          the actual flag that causes the failure
