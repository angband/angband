# Some fields accept randomized numbers of the form "10+2d3M4" where
# 10 is the non-variable base, 2d3 is a standard die roll, and
# M4 uses the m_bonus function to generate a number between 0 and
# 4 according to a normal distribution.  All three components are
# optional, and the number of dice is optional and assumed to be 1
# when not specified.  10+2d3M4 has the range 12-20.  10+M4 has the
# range 10-14.  10+2d3 has the range 12-16.  10+d3 has the range 11-13.
# 2d3, d3, M4, 2d3M4, and d3M4 are all acceptable as well.

# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry. The '&' and '~' symbols are use to
# include articles and pluralization as necessary to ensure
# grammatical correctness in object descriptions.
#
# For non-English and irregular plurals, the '|' symbol may be used
# instead, as in "|singular|plural|". The part between the first and
# second | symbol is used for singular, and the part between the second
# and third | for plural.  The number of | symbols in the name must
# always be a multiple of 3.

# 'graphics' is for symbol and color. There are 27 colors, as
# follows:

# D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Umber
# W - Light Gray   P - Light Purple   y - Yellow        R - Light Red
# G - Light Green  B - Light Blue     U - Light Umber   p - Purple
# v - Violet       t - Teal           m - Mud           Y - Light Yellow
# i - Magenta-Pink T - Light Teal     V - Light Violet  I - Light Pink
# M - Mustard      z - Blue Slate     Z - Deep Light Blue

# Another color, "d", is used for "flavoured" items.

# 'type' is for the base type of item, from object_base.txt.

# 'properties' is for level, weight and cost. Level defines how "advanced"
# the object is, when determining how easy it is to use a wand, staff or rod;
# weight is in tenth-pounds; cost is the item's base value.

# 'combat' is for combat information. The items base armor class, its base
# damage and pluses to-hit, to-dam and to-ac.  The latter three numbers
# accept randomized values.

# 'alloc' is for allocation - depth and rarity, in pairs. It is used to
# ensure that certain vital items such as food and recall scrolls
# are found throughout the dungeon. The "allocation" depth need not
# match the depth as specified in the "properties:" line.

# 'charges' is for charges (wands and staves only).  This field accepts
# randomized values.

# 'pile' is for piling behaviour - how likely the item is to be found in a
# pile, and how many (random value) objects in such a pile.  Objects
# without a pile line appear singly.

# 'flags' is for flags, which can be either object flags (as found in
# src/list-object-flags.h) or kind flags (src/list-kind-flags.h).  As many
# flags: lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags, and
# flags are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'values' is for object modifiers which take a value - stats, slays, brands,
# resistances and so on.  An example is SLAY_UNDEAD[3], which denotes that
# the weapon concerned has a basic 3x slay against undead creatures.  Like
# flags, values are separated by '|' and as many values: lines as needed
# can be used.

# 'power' is used in calculating the power of the object for pricing and 
# generating random artifacts.  It reflects the power of the effect of the
# object; other properties are taken into account separately in power
# calculation.

# 'msg' is any message printed on using the object.

# 'effect' is for the effect when an object is eaten, activated or whatever.
# Fields are the name of the effect (as found in src/list-effects.h) and
# possibly one or two parameters to the effect.

# 'param' is for an extra to an effect if necessary

# 'dice' provides a random value to be used by an effect (for damage,
# healing, etc).  As well as the normal random value fields described above,
# it can contain expressions like $B, which refer forward to an 'expr' line.

# 'expr' provides an expression for use in effect dice.  It consists of a
# code letter (eg B) for the expression, a base function to use (for example
# PLAYER_LEVEL), and a sequence of operations to perform on that base.

# 'msg' provides a message to give when the object is used.

# 'time' gives a random value to be used as the time to recharge for a rod or
# activatable item.

# 'pval' is for pval - an auxiliary value that can mean food value, launcher
# multiplier or turns of light. A pval can take a random value.

# 'desc' is for description. As many desc: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the object. Note that lines will need spaces at their
# ends or the beginning of the next line to prevent words from running
# together.
