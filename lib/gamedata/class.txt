# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new class.

# 'stats' is for the stat modifiers - strength, intelligence, wisdom,
# dexterity, constitution.

# 'skill-<skill name>' is for skills - physical and magical disarming,
# magic devices, saving throws, stealth, to hit (normal), to hit (bows),
# to hit (throwing), digging.  The base entry is what gets added to the
# character's skills at birth, the increments are added to the base skill
# every ten levels.

# 'info' is for extra info - max. hitpoints gained per level, experience
# factor in percent.

# 'attack' is for attack info - maximum possible number of attacks, minimum
# weapon weight for calculating the number of attacks, multiplier for
# attack calculations.

# 'equip' is for starting equipment - tval of the item, sval of the item,
# minimum amount, maximum amount.

# 'flags' is for class flags.

# 'title' is for class titles.

# 'magic' is for general magic info - level of the first spell, weight that
# hurts spells, number of books used.

# 'book' defines one of these books - object base, whether a town or a dungeon
# book, name, number of spells, book realm.  A book needs to be defined for
# each class which uses it, as otherwise it is not recognised as one of that
# class's books.

# 'book-graphics' is for symbol and color as used in object.txt.
# 'book-graphics:' lines refer to the previous book line, and need not be
# included if a book of the same name has been defined earlier.

# 'book-properties' is for object properties of a book - cost, commonness,
# and minimum and maximum depths of occurrence.
# 'book-properties:' lines refer to the previous book line, and need not be
# included if a book of the same name has been defined earlier.

# 'spell' defines an individual spell - name, level, mana required,
# fail-rate, experience for first casting.    'spell:' lines always refer to
# spells in the previous 'book:' line.  The lines below are all used in
# reference to the previous 'spell:' line.

# 'effect' defines the spell effect (as listed in src/list-effects.h),
# and optionally parameters for effect subtype, effect radius and
# an extra parameter for various things

# 'dice' provides a random value to be used by an effect (for damage,
# healing, etc).  As well as the normal random value fields described above,
# it can contain expressions like $B, which refer forward to an 'expr' line.

# 'expr' provides an expression for use in effect dice.  It consists of a
# code letter (eg B) for the expression, a base function to use (for example
# PLAYER_LEVEL), and a sequence of operations to perform on that base.

# 'effect-msg' provides a message which can be used in whatever way the effect
# needs, typically to print during the effect, or as a death message.

# 'desc' is for description. As many desc: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the spell. Note that lines will need spaces at their
# ends or the beginning of the next line to prevent words from running
# together.
