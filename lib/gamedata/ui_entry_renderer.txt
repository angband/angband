# File: ui_entry_renderer.txt

# Configure how a quantity is rendered in the user interface.  Currently only
# used for the parts of the second character screen.

# The name is used to link the renderer with a user interface element in
# ui_entry.txt so changes here would have to be mirrored there to keep the
# link.
# code binds the renderer to a specific backend in the executable.  It must
# be one of the values listed in list-ui-entry-renderers.h.
# colors and labelcolors configure the palette of colors used for either the
# value or the label.  How indices into the palette are used depends on the
# backend the renderer is bound to.  Changes to colors and labelcolors can
# affect usability.  Both are optional; if not set, default values from the
# backend are used.
# symbols defines the palette of symbols the renderer uses if it converts
# values to symbols (some of the rendering functions won't use the symbols
# field).  How indices into the palette are used depends on the backend the
# renderer is bound to.  Changes to symbols can affect usability.  It is
# optional.  If not set, defaults values from the backend are used.
# ndigit is the number of digits to display for a numeric value.  That is
# only used by some renders and does not need to be set.  If set it must be a
# positive integer.  If not set, the default value from the backend will be
# used.
# sign configures whether a sign indicator is shown with numeric values.  That
# is only used by some renderers and does not need to be set.  If set, it
# must be one of the following:  NO_SIGN, ALWAYS_SIGN, or NEGATIVE_SIGN.
# NO_SIGN specifies that no sign indicator will be shown.  ALWAYS_SIGN
# specifies that a sign indicator will always be shown (+ will be used for
# zeros).  NEGATIVE_SIGN specifies that a sign indicator will only be shown
# for negative values.  If not set, the default value from the backend will be
# used.
# units configures whether a label is shown immediately after numeric values.
# This is only used by some renderers and does not need to be set.  By default,
# numeric values will not be labeled with units.

# COMPACT_RESIST_RENDERER_WITH_COMBINED_AUX renders one or more resistance
# values with the label colored by the combined resistance.  The auxiliary
# values are treated as timed resistances.  One of nine symbols (unknown,
# not present, none, resist, vulnerable, immune, timed resist, timed
# vulnerability, timed immunity) are used for each resistance value.  The
# symbols for the timed effects are only used if the permanent effect is known
# and is none.  Each of those symbols has a corresponding color (from the
# first 9 colors) and alternate color (from the second 9 colors).  The
# alternate color is used for every other resist.  A palette of 8 colors is
# used for the label.  They are:
# unknown rune
# no permanent resistance or immunity and no timed effects
# at least one permanent resistance and no permanent immunity
# at least one permanent immunity
# at least one permanent vulnerability and no permanent resistance or immunity
# no permanent effects or timed immunity and at least one timed resistance
# no permanent effects, timed resistance, or timed immunity and at least one
#     timed vulnerability
# no permanent effects and at last one timed immunity

# COMPACT_FLAG_RENDERER_WITH_COMBINED_AUX renders one or more boolean flags
# with the label colored by the combined (logical or) value.  The auxiliary
# values are treated as timed effects.  One of five symbols (unknown, not
# present, off, on, timed on) is used for each flag.  The symbol for the
# timed effect is only used if the permanant effect is known and is off.  Each
# of three symbols has a corresponding color (from the first five colors) and
# alternate color (from the second five colors).  The alternate color is used
# for every other flag.  A palette of four colors is used for the label.  They
# are unknown rune, no flags are known to be on and there is no timed effect,
# at least one flag is on, and no flags are known to be on but there is at
# least one timed effect.

# NUMERIC_AS_SIGN_RENDERER_WITH_COMBINED_AUX renders one or more integer
# modifiers with the label colored by the combined (by addition) value.  The
# auxiliary values are treated as timed effects.  One of seven symbols
# (unknown, not present, zero, positive, negative, timed positive, timed
# negative) is used for each modifier.  The symbols for the timed effects are
# only used if the permanent effect is known and is zero.  Each of the symbols
# has a corresponding color (from the first seven colors) and alternate color
# (from the second seven colors).  The alternate color is used for every other
# modifier.  A palette of six colors is used for the label.  They are:
# unknown rune
# the sum of the known effects is zero and the sum of the timed effects is zero
# the sum of the known effects is positive
# the sum of the known effects is negative
# the sum of the known effects is zero; the sum of the timed effects is
#     positive
# the sum of the known effects is zero; the sum of the timed effects is
#     negative

# NUMERIC_RENDERER_WITH_COMBINED_AUX renders one or more integer values
# as decimal integers with the label colored by the combined value.  The
# auxiliary values are treated as timed effects.  One of seven colors (unknown,
# not present, zero, positive, negative, timed positive, timed negative) or an
# alternate set of seven colors for those same conditions is used for each
# modifer.  The alternate colors are used for every other value.  The colors
# for the timed effects are only used if the permanent effect is known and is
# zero.  There are seven symbols that may be used.  The first symbol is used
# in place of digits when the value is unknown.  The second symbol is used in
# place of digts when the value is not present.  The third symbol is used when
# both the value and the auxiliary value are zero.  If it is '0', then it may
# be shown with a sign, depending on the the setting for the sign indicator
# described below.  The fourth symbol is used in place of digits when the
# known permanent effect is positive and the value is too large to display with
# the given number of digits.  The fifth symbol is used in place of digits when
# the known permanent effect is negative and the value is too large to display
# with the given number of digits.  The sixth symbol is used in place of digits
# when the known permanent effect is zero and the timed effect is positive but
# too large to display with the given number of digits.  The seventh symbol is
# used in place of digits when the known permanent effect is zero and the
# timed effect is negative but too large to display with the given number of
# digits.  A palette of six colors is used for the label.  They are:
# unknown rune
# the sum of the known effects is zero and the sum of the timed effects is zero
# the sum of the known effects is positive
# the sum of the known effects is negative
# the sum of the known effects is zero; the sum of the timed effects is
#     positive
# the sum of the known effects is zero; the sum of the timed effects is
#     negative
#
# The number of digits is used to configure the number of digits shown for
# each value.  The default value for the number of digits is one.  The sign
# display is used to configure whether the digits are shown with a sign
# indicator.  By default, a sign indicator will not be shown.  By default, a
# sign indicator will not be shown.  The units label configures whether that
# label is shown after each numeric value.  By default, no such label is shown.

# NUMERIC_RENDERER_WITH_BOOL_AUX renders one or more integer values
# as decimal integers with the label colored by the combined value.  The
# auxiliary values are treated as booleans (one use would be for sustains).
# One of eight colors (unknown, not present, zero with the auxilary flag off,
# zero with the auxiliary flag on, positive with the auxiliary flag off,
# positive with the auxiliary flag on, negative with the auxiliary flag off,
# negative with the auxiliary flag on) or an alternate set of eight colors for
# those same conditions is used for each modifier.  The alternate colors are
# used for every other value.  There are six symbols that may be used.  The
# first symbol is used in place of digits when the value is unknown.  The
# second symbol is used in place of digits when the value is not present.  The
# third symbol is used when the value is zero and the auxiliary flag is off.
# If it is '0', then it may be shown with a sign, depending on the the setting
# for the sign indicator described below.  The fourth symbol is used when the
# value is zero and auxiliary flag is on.  If it is '0', then it may be shown
# with a sign, depending on the the setting for the sign indicator described
# below.  The fifth symbol is used in place of digits when the value is
# positive and too large to display with the given number of digits.  The
# sixth symbol is used in place of digits when the value is negative and too
# large to display with the given number of digits.  A palette of seven colors
# is used for the label.  They are:
# unknown rune
# the sum of the known values is zero and none of the auxiliary flags are on
# the sum of the known values is zero and at least one auxiliary flag is on
# the sum of the known values is positive and none of the auxiliary flags is on
# the sum of the known values is positive and at least one auxiliary flag is on
# the sum of the known values is negative and none of the auxiliary flags is on
# the sum of the known values is positive and at least one auxiliary flag is on
#
# The number of digits is used to configure the number of digits shown for
# each value.  The default value for the number of digits is one.  The sign
# display is used to configure whether the digits are shown with a sign
# indicator.  By default, a sign indicator will not be shown.  The units label
# configures whether that label is shown after each numeric value.  By default,
# no such label is shown.
