# file: dungeon_profile.txt

# Contains information about how each type of dungeon level (and the town)
# are generated.

# name: The profile name.  This needs to match the corresponding entry in 
# list-dun-profiles.h so the correct level-building function can be called

# params: block_size : rooms : unusual : rarity
# block_size is the size of the blocks which the dungeon is divided into; a
# room will never cross a block boundary.  rooms is the number of rooms to
# aim for.  unusual is a measure of how likely high rarity roooms are to
# appear - higher values give less rare rooms.  rarity is the maximum rarity
# room allowed with this cave profile

# tunnel: rnd : chg : con : pen : jct
# These are percentage chances - rnd of choosing a random tunnel direction
# (as opposed to heading in the desired direction), chg the chance of changing
# direction, at any tunnel grid, con the chance of just terminating a tunnel,
# pen the chance of putting a door in a room entrance, jct the chance of a
# door at a tunnel junction.

# streamer: den : rng : mag : mc : qua : qc
# Streamers are drawn as a random walk which stops at the dungeon edge.
# den is the number of grids near any walk grid to make streamer; rng is how
# far from the walk those grids can be; mag and qua are the numbers of magma
# and quartz streamers per level; 1/mc and 1/qc are the chances of treasure in
# magma and quartz.

# alloc is used to decide which profile to use.  For a profile that has a
# positive value for alloc, the profile will be used for a level that satisfies
# the profile's min-level with a probability of the value of alloc divided by
# the sum of the alloc values for all other possible profiles at that level.
# Except for the town profile, if alloc is zero or less than -1, the profile
# will not be used.  If alloc is -1, the profile can only be selected by
# hard-coded tests in generate.c for the profile selection.  If those tests do
# not already include the profile, using a value of -1 will be the same as
# using 0 for alloc.  The hard-coded tests currently include checks for the
# town, moria, and labyrinth profiles.

# min-level is the shallowest dungeon level on which the profile can be used

# room: name : rating : height : width : level : pit : rarity : cutoff
# name is the room name, which must match the name in list-rooms.h so the 
# correct room-building function can be called.
# rating is used only for template rooms
# height and width are the maximum dimensions of the room, and define how much
# space is allocated for that room.
# level is the minimum depth at which this room can appear.
# pit is 1 if the room is a pit/nest, 0 otherwise.
# rarity is the room's rarity - normally 0, 1 or 2 (see comments about profile
# rarity above).  Some rooms are chosen by a different means; in this case
# rarity is usually 0.
# cutoff is used to pick between rooms once a rarity is chosen:  a random value
# from 0 to 99 is selected and a room may appear if its cutoff is greater than
# that value.  It is IMPORTANT that non-zero cutoffs appear in ascending order
# within the rooms of the same rarity for a given profile:  a room with a
# smaller cutoff appearing after one with a larger cutoff will never be
# selected.
