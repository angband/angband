# Descriptions and messages can be edited without bad effects.
# Changing code may have unpredictable results.
# Changing the name, reordering, or adding whole new entires will severely
# disrupt the game, and should only be done when the associated list-*.h
# files (and other code) are also  being changed, and the game recompiled.

#    player  - special player flag from list-player-flags.h
#    object  - object flag from list-object-flags.h
#    element - resistance, immunity or vulnerability to an element
# code - the property name used by the game. Element codes are templates, and
#        one is made for each element
# name - the name of the property
