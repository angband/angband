# File: player_property.txt

# Used in conjunction with list-player-flags.h, list-object-flags.h and
# list-elements.h
# Player properties

# Descriptions and names can be edited without bad effects.
# Changing the code, or type will severely disrupt the game, and should only
# be done when the associated list-*.h files (and other code) are also
# being changed, and the game recompiled.
# Adding new entries will have no effect without further datafile and code
# changes

# Fields:
# type - the type of player property.  Valid types are
#    player  - special player flag from list-player-flags.h
#    object  - object flag from list-object-flags.h
#    element - resistance, immunity or vulnerability to an element
# code - the property name used by the game. Element codes are templates, and
#        one is made for each element
# bindui - Binds the property to a user interface element in ui_entry.txt.
#          When binding an element property, the name will be parameterized
#          with the element name.  Takes two parameters.  The first is an
#          integer, which if nonzero, says the value is passed to the user
#          interface element as an auxiliary one (used on some to indicate a
#          sustain, for instance).  The second is the value to pass.  That can
#          be an integer or "special" where the latter indicates that the
#          value passed will be determined internally.  bindui currently only
#          affects parts of the second character screen.  It can appear
#          multiple times for the same entry to bind it to multiple user
#          interface elements.
# name - the name of the property
# desc - the description of the property
# value - value for elements; -1 (vulnerability), 1 (resistance) or 3 (immunity)
