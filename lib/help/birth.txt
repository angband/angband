=== Creating a Character ===

Angband is a roleplaying game, in which you, the player, control a 
character in the world of Angband.  Perhaps the most important thing you 
control is the birth of your character, in which you choose or allow to 
be chosen various attributes that will affect the future life of your 
character.

At the character creation screen you will be prompted to select the sex, 
race and class of your character.  You also have the option to change 
the 'birth options' at this time.  These need to be set at the character 
creation menu and cannot be altered later in the game.  They are 
discussed with the rest of the options in the "options" help file.


=== Character Characteristics ===

Each character has three primary attributes: sex, race, and class. These 
are chosen at the beginning and which will stay fixed for the entire 
life of that character.  The sex of your character is purely for 
flavour, but the race and class have many effects which are discussed in 
detail below.

Each character has a few secondary attributes: height, weight, social 
class, and background history.  These are randomly determined, but are 
affected by the sex and race of the character.  In general, these 
attributes are only used to provide flavour to the character, to assist 
in the role playing, but they do have a few minor effects on the game.  
For example, background history affects social class, which affects the 
starting money. (Not a lot, in the case of some races: for instance, 
Half-Trolls are always going to be the scum of society, even if their 
father was the Clan Chief.)

Each character also has six primary "stats": strength, intelligence, 
wisdom, dexterity, constitution, and charisma, which modify the 
abilities of the character in a variety of ways.  Every stat has a 
numerical value, ranging from a minimum of 3, up to a normal maximum of 
18, and even higher, into the "percentile" range, represented as "18/01" 
through "18/100": this is the maximum that can be achieved 
intrinsically, for any given stat.  These stats can be modified further 
by equipment, race and class bonuses up to a maximum of 18/220.

Each character also has several primary "skills": disarming, magic 
devices, saving throws, stealth, searching ability, searching frequency, 
fighting skill, and shooting skill, which are derived from the 
character's race, class, level, stats, and current equipment.  These 
skills have rather obvious effects, but will be described more 
completely below.

Each character may have one or more "racially intrinsic skills", based 
on the race of the character.  These may include special resistances, or 
abilities such as infravision.

Each character has a number of "experience points", which increases as 
the character defeats monsters and attempts new spells and uses new 
items.  Characters also have a level, which is based on experience.  The 
amount of experience required to gain a new level is dependent on the 
character race and class.  Races and classes with more intrinsic 
benefits require more experience to gain levels.  As the experience 
rises, so does the level, and as the level rises, certain other 
abilities and characteristics rise as well.  All characters start at 0 
experience and at the first level.

Each character has some gold, which can be used to buy items from the 
shops in the town, and which can be obtained not only from selling items 
to the shops, but also by taking it from dead monsters and by finding it 
in the dungeon.  Each character starts out with some gold, the amount of 
which is based on the character's social class (higher is better), 
charisma (higher is better), and stats (less powerful characters start 
with more gold).  Each character also starts out with a few useful 
items, which may be kept, or sold to a shop-keeper for more gold. 
However, especially valuable items will never sell for the full price, 
as each shopkeeper has a maximum that he is prepared to pay for any 
item. The more generous shopkeepers may buy your items for up to 30,000 
gold pieces: but some are really stingy, and will pay no more than 
5,000.

Each character has an "armour class", abbreviated to AC, representing 
how well the character can avoid damage.  The armour class is affected 
by dexterity and equipment, so the concept includes both avoiding blows 
and being able to take blows without being hurt.  Armour class on 
equipment is always denoted in [square brackets], usually as a figure of 
[X,+Y] where X is the intrinsic AC of the armour in question, and Y is 
the magical bonus to armour class provided by that item.

Each character has "hit points", or hp, representing how much damage the 
character can sustain before he dies.  How many hit points a character 
has is determined by race, class, level and constitution, as follows: 
each race has a basic "hit dice" number - for instance, a Dwarf's basic 
hit die is 11, while a hobbit's is 7. This is modified by class: for 
instance, a warrior gets a +9 bonus to the hit die, while a mage gets no 
bonus and a priest +2, so a dwarven warrior's total hit die will be 
(11+9)=20 - meaning that he gets between 1 and 20 hit points per level. 
If he were a priest, his hit dice would be (11+2)=13, and get between 1 
and 13 hit points per level. The hobbit mage would get only 1-7 hps per 
level. (All characters get the maximum at first level: thereafter it is 
a random roll of 1dX where X is the hit die number, when the character 
goes up in level.) This is further modified by constitution - a 
character with high constitution will get a flat bonus of a certain 
number of hit points per level (recalculated right back to level 1: if 
you gain an extra hit point per level, and you are 42nd level, you will 
suddenly be 42 hit points better off.)

Each character has spell points, or mana, which limits how many spells 
(or prayers) a character can cast (or pray).  The maximum number of 
spell points is derived from your class, level, and intelligence (for 
spells) or wisdom (for prayers), and you can never have more spell 
points than the maximum.  Spell points may be regained by resting, or by 
magical means.  Warriors never have any spell points.  If a character 
gains enough wisdom or intelligence to get more spell points, the result 
is calculated right back to first level, just as with constitution and 
hit points.

Lastly, each character has a base speed.  Speed determines the amount of 
"energy" your character acquires in the game, and therefore how often 
you can take actions which use up energy (like moving or attacking).  
All beginning characters move at normal speed and the only way to 
increase speed is by magical means and equipment bonuses.  Characters 
who are carrying too much weight will move more slowly.  Extra speed is 
one of the most important boons in the game and therefore one of the 
rarest and most sought after.


=== Races ===

There are eleven different races that you can choose to play in Angband.  
Each race has its own adjustments to a character's stats and abilities. 
Most races also have intrinsic abilities.  The bonuses to statistics and 
the experience penalty will be displayed next to the races as you move 
to select one.

***** <Human>
          Human
               The human is the base character.  All other races are com-
               pared to them.  Humans are average at everything and tend to go
               up levels faster than any other race due to their shorter life
               spans.  No racial adjustments or intrinsics occur to human
               characters.  Humans do not have any infravision.

***** <Half-Elf>
          Half-Elf
               Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a human,  but
               not as wise or strong.  Half-elves are slightly better at magic,
               disarming, saving throws, stealth, archery and searching, but
               they are not as good at hand-to-hand combat.  Half-elves are
               immune to dexterity draining, and have weak infravision.

***** <Elf>
          Elf
               Elves are better magicians than humans, but not as good at
               fighting.  They tend to be smarter and faster than humans, 
               though not as wise or strong.  Elves are better at searching, 
               disarming, perception, stealth, archery and magic, but they are 
               not as good at hand-to-hand combat. They are resistant to
               attacks involving bright light, are immune to dexterity
               draining, and have fair infravision.

***** <Hobbit>
          Hobbits
               Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at shooting, throwing, and
               have good saving throws.  They also are very good at search-
               ing, disarming, perception, and stealth; so they make excel-
               lent rogues, but prefer to be called burglars.  They will be
               much weaker than humans, and not good at melee fighting.
               Halflings have fair infravision.  They have a strong hold 
               on their life force, and are thus resistant to life
               draining.  Hobbits are very partial to mushrooms and can
               identify them when found.

***** <Gnome>
          Gnome
               Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than halflings.
               They, like  the halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like
               homes.  Gnomes make excellent mages, and have very good saving
               throws.  They are good at searching, disarming, perception,
               and stealth.  They have lower strength than humans so they
               are not very good at fighting with hand weapons.  Gnomes have
               good infravision, so they can detect warm-blooded creatures
               up to 40 feet away.  Gnomes are intrinsically protected against
               paralysis and some slowing effects.  Gnomes are excellent at
               using wands and staves and can identify them when found.

***** <Dwarf>
          Dwarf
               Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.
               Since dungeons are the natural home of a dwarf, they are
               excellent choices for a warrior or priest - or indeed, that
               combination of the two, the paladin.  Dwarves tend to be
               stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent than
               humans.  Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat wise,
               they resist spells which are cast on them.  Dwarves also have
               excellent infravision.  They can never be blinded.  Dwarves 
               are excellent at digging, and can sense nearby buried treasure. 
               They have one big drawback, though.  Dwarves are loudmouthed and
               proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with themselves for no
               good reason, screaming out challenges at imagined foes.  In
               other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth. 

***** <Half-Orc>
          Half-Orc
               Half-Orcs make excellent warriors and decent priests, but
               are terrible at magic.  They are as bad as dwarves at stealth,
               and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception.
               Half-Orcs are, let's face it, ugly.  They tend to pay more for
               goods in town.  Half-Orcs do make good warriors and rogues,
               for the simple reason that Half-Orcs tend to have great
               constitution and lots of hit points.  Because of their
               preference to living underground to on the surface, half-orcs
               resist darkness attacks.  They have fair infravision.

***** <Half-Troll>
          Half-Troll
               Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points
               than any other character race.  They are also very stupid and
               slow.  They will make great warriors and iffy priests.  They
               are bad at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth.
               They are so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence.
               Half-trolls always have their strength sustained, and they 
               regenerate quickly like other trolls.  Unfortunately, this 
               regeneration also requires them to eat more food than other 
               races.  They have fair infravision.

***** <Dunadan>
          Dunadan
               Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West.  This elder
               race surpasses human abilities in every field, especially
               constitution.  However, being men of the world, very little is
               new to them, and levels are very hard to gain...  their
               hardiness ensures that their constitution cannot be reduced.  
               They have no infravision.

***** <High-Elf>
          High-Elf
               High-Elves are descended from those among the Elves who heard 
               and answered the call from the Valar at the very beginning of 
               time, before the sun and moon were made, and lived in the 
               Blessed Realm for many thousands of years before returning to 
               mortal lands.  Because of this, they are far superior in terms 
               of abilities when compared to their lesser Elven kindred.  They 
               can also see into the invisible world of ghosts and wraiths. 
               However, they find new experience even harder to come by than 
               Dunedain.  Like normal Elves, they resist attacks involving 
               bright light.  They have good infravision and can even see 
               cold-blooded invisible creatures.

***** <Kobold>
          Kobold
               Kobolds are a race of small dog-headed humanoids that dwell 
               underground.  They have excellent infravision, and are 
               intrinsically resistant to poisons of all kinds.  They have 
               a good dexterity and constitution.  However, they are 
               weaker than humans, and also not noted for great 
               intelligence.  Furthermore, they are ugly, and not 
               trusted in town.  And while their constitution makes them 
               tough, it still cannot prevent the fact that they are not the 
               biggest of creatures, and have few hit points.


=== Classes ===

Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class.  The class 
is the character's occupation and determines stat bonuses, abilities, 
hit dice, and what spells (if any) the character can learn.

***** <Warrior>
          Warrior
               A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of
               his problems by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally
               fall back on the help of a magical device.  His prime stats
               are strength, constitution, and dexterity, and he will strike
               more blows with melee weapons than any other class.  A Warrior
               will be excellent at fighting, shooting and throwing, but bad
               at most other skills.  A warrior has bad stealth and cannot
               learn any spells.

***** <Mage>
          Mage
               A Mage must live by his wits.  He cannot hope to simply hack
               his way through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his
               magic to defeat, deceive, confuse, and escape.  A mage is
               not really complete without an assortment of magical devices
               to use in addition to his spells.  He can master the higher
               level magical devices far easier than anyone else, and has
               the excellent saving throws to resist effects of spells cast at
               him.  However, he is incredibly weak, getting few hit dice 
               and suffering strong penalties to strength and constitution.  
               Intelligence is his primary stat and at high levels he can 
               cast many spells without a chance of failure.  There is no 
               rule that says a mage cannot become a good fighter, but 
               spells are his true realm and he will get fewer blows with
               melee weapons than other classes.

***** <Priest>
          Priest
               A Priest is a character of holy devotion.  They explore the
               dungeon only to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if
               treasure just happens to fall into their packs, well, so
               much more to the glory of their church!  Priests receive
               their spells from a deity, and therefore do not choose which
               spells they will learn.  They are familiar with magical 
               devices, preferring to call them "instruments of God", but 
               are not as good as a mage in their use.  Priests have great 
               saving throws, and make decent fighters, but they are not 
               as good at using sharp weapons (swords and polearms) owing to
               the Church's strictures about shedding blood, so they are 
               better off using blunt weapons such as maces.  Wisdom is the 
               priest's primary stat and at high enough levels they can cast 
               many prayers without a chance of failure.  Priests have poor 
               stealth.

***** <Rogue>
          Rogue
               A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his cunning,
               but is capable of fighting his way out of a tight spot.  He
               is the master of traps and locks, no device being impossible
               for him to overcome.  A rogue has a high stealth allowing
               him to sneak around many creatures without having to fight,
               or sneak up and get the first blow.  A rogue's perception is
               higher than any other class, and many times he will notice a
               trap or secret door before having to search.  A rogue is
               better than warriors or paladins with magical devices, but
               still cannot rely on their performance.  Rogues can also
               learn a few spells, but not the powerful offensive spells
               mages can use, and there will always be a chance of failure 
               even with the simplest spells.  A rogue's primary stats are 
               dexterity and intelligence.

***** <Ranger>
          Ranger
               A Ranger is a warrior/mage and a very powerful class.  He is 
               a good fighter, and the best of all the classes with missile 
               weapons, especially bows.  The ranger learns spells much more 
               slowly than a mage, but is capable of learning all but the 
               most powerful spells.  Because a ranger is really a dual 
               class character, more experience is required for him to 
               advance.  A ranger has good stealth, good perception, good 
               searching, a good saving throw, and is good with magical 
               devices.  His primary stats are strength, intelligence and 
               dexterity.

***** <Paladin>
          Paladin
               A Paladin is a warrior/priest.  He is a very good fighter,
               second only to the warrior class, but not very good at mis-
               sile weapons.  He receives prayers at a slower pace then the
               priest, but can use all but the most powerful prayers.
               Because a paladin is really a dual class character, it
               requires more experience to advance him.  A paladin lacks
               much in the way of abilities. He is poor at stealth, per-
               ception, searching, and  magical devices.  He has a decent
               saving throw due to his divine alliance.  His primary stats
               are strength and wisdom.
 

=== Stats === 

After gender, race and class are selected, you will be able to decide 
what stat levels your character will have, by allocating a finite number 
of "points" between the six statistics.  These points can be allocated 
by selection or with a random roller (as described below in the "Stat 
Rollers" section).  Each race/class combination also has a recommended 
default setting for these statistics.  Statistics can be permanently 
raised by various potions in the dungeon up to 18/100.  They can also be 
temporarily drained by some monster attacks.


          Strength
               Strength is important in fighting with weapons and in melee
               combat.  A high strength can improve your chances of hitting
               as well as the amount of damage done with each hit.  Char-
               acters with low strengths may receive penalties.  Strength 
               raises the amount of weight you can carry before being slowed.
               It also allows you to get extra blows with heavier weapons.  
               Strength is one of the most important stats in the beginning 
               of the game.
 
          Intelligence
               Intelligence affects the spellcasting abilities of mage-like
               spellcasters: mages, rangers, and rogues.  Intelligence
               will affect the number of spells you may learn each level as
               well as the number of spell points you receive.  Intelligence 
               is the most important stat for mages.  A high
               intelligence may also improve your chances of successfully
               casting a spell.  You cannot learn spells if your intelligence
               is 7 or lower.  A good intelligence can also help with using
               magic devices, picking locks, and disarming traps.
 
          Wisdom
               The primary function of wisdom is to determine the ability
               of a priest or paladin to use prayers, just like intelligence
               affects spellcasting.  Again, high wisdom will increase the
               number of mana points you have and increase the number of
               prayers you can learn each level, while improving the chance
               that a prayer will be successful.  A good wisdom increases 
               your saving throw, thereby improving your chances of resisting 
               magical spells cast upon you by monsters.
 
          Dexterity
               Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness.  A high
               dexterity may allow a character to get multiple blows with
               lighter weapons.  Dexterity also increases a character's
               chances of hitting with any weapon and of dodging blows from
               enemies.  Dexterity is also useful in picking locks, disarming
               traps, and protecting yourself from some of the thieves that
               inhabit the dungeons. Indeed, if the character has a high
               enough dexterity, thieves will never be successful in stealing
               from him.
 
          Constitution
               Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his
               body, and to recover from damage received.  Therefore a
               character with a high constitution will receive more hit
               points and also recover them faster while resting.  Constitution
               is less important in the beginning of the game, but will be the
               most important stat at the end.
 
          Charisma
               Charisma represents a character's personality and physical
               appearance.  A character with a high charisma will receive
               better prices from store owners, whereas a character with a
               very low charisma may be robbed blind. 
 

=== Skills ===

Characters possess some different skills which can help them to survive.  
The starting skill levels of a character are based upon race and class.  
Skill levels may be adjusted by high or low stats, and may increase with 
the level of the character.

          Infravision
               Infravision is the ability to see heat sources.  Since most
               of the dungeon is cool or cold, infravision will not allow
               the player to see walls and objects.  Infravision will allow
               a character to see any warm-blooded creatures up to a cer-
               tain distance.  This ability works equally well with or with-
               out a light source.  However, some of Angband's creatures are
               cold-blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by a
               light source.  All non-human races have innate infravision. 
               Humans (including Dunedain) cannot gain infravision unless it
               is magically enhanced.  Infravision does not increase with
               character level, and is purely dependent on race and on 
               magical equipment.
 
          Fighting
               Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or
               fists.  Normally a character gets a single blow from any
               weapon, but if his dexterity and strength are high enough,
               he may receive more blows with lighter weapons.  Strength and
               dexterity both modify the ability to hit an opponent.  This 
               skill increases with the level of the character.  Inspecting a
               weapon will show you how quickly you can attack with it.
 
          Shooting Ability
               Using ranged missile weapons (and throwing objects) is
               included in this skill.  Different stats apply to different
               weapons, but this ability may modify the distance an object
               is thrown/fired, the amount of damage done, and the ability
               to hit a creature.  This skill increases with the level of
               the character.
 
          Saving Throws
               A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the
               effects of a spell cast on him by another person/creature.
               This does not include spells cast on the player by his own
               stupidity, such as quaffing a nasty potion.  This ability
               increases with the level of the character, but then most
               high level creatures are better at casting spells, so it
               tends to even out.  A high wisdom also increases this abil-
               ity.  It is possible to get 100% saving throw, making you 
               immune to many attacks.
 
          Stealth
               The ability to move silently about is very useful.  Charac-
               ters with good stealth can usually surprise their opponents,
               gaining the first blow.  Also, creatures may fail to notice
               a stealthy character entirely, allowing a player to avoid
               certain fights.  This skill is based entirely upon race and
               class, and will never improve unless magically enhanced.
 
          Disarming
               Disarming is the ability to remove traps safely, and also
               includes picking locks on traps and doors.  A successful
               disarming or lock picking will gain the character a small 
               amount of experience.  A trap must be found before it can 
               be disarmed.  Dexterity and intelligence both modify the 
               ability to disarm, and this ability increases with the 
               level of the character.
 
          Magical Devices
               Using a magical device such as a wand or staff requires
               experience and knowledge.  Spell users such as mages and
               priests are therefore much better at using a magical device
               than say a warrior.  This skill is modified by intelligence,
               and increases with the level of the character.

          Searching Frequency (Perception)
               Perception is the ability to notice something without
               actively seeking it out.  This skill is based entirely upon
               race and class, and will never improve unless magically
               enhanced.

          Searching Ability (Searching)
               To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps,
               and traps on chests.  Rogues are the best at searching, but
               mages, rangers, and priests are also good at it.  This skill
               is based entirely upon race and class, and will never
               improve unless magically enhanced.


 
=== Stat Bonus Tables ===

Stats, hit dice, infravision and experience point modifications due to 
race and class are listed in the following table.  To get the total hit 
dice and XP modifier, add the "race" and "class" numbers: for instance, 
a Dwarf Priest has a hit die of 11+2=13 (i.e. he will get 1d13 hit 
points per level, adjusted for constitution) and an XP modifier of 
20+20=40%.

For character classes, there are two figures: the first figure is the 
base level of the skill, while the second figure (in parentheses) is 
the bonus that the character gains to this skill every ten levels. So, 
to find out the total skill value of any character's skills, add the 
"race" value to the "class" value, and then the bonus once for every ten 
levels that the character has.

Please note, however, that these numbers are only good for comparing 
characters to each other in the absence of other bonuses from high stats 
(strength bonus to-dam, dex bonus to-hit, wisdom bonus to saving throw, 
intelligence bonus to magical device usage, etc.) or wearing magical 
items.


=== Stat rollers ===

There are currently two different ways to determine the starting stats of
your character - you can choose which one to use from the birth screen.

***** <Point-based>
          Point-based
              The point-based method allows you to "buy" improvements to
              your basic stats by "spending" points on them.  You have a
              fixed number of points to spend, and making small changes
              to a stat costs proportionally less than making large changes.
              Any unspent points are converted into your starting money that 
              you can use to buy equipment at the start of the game.

              On selecting this option, you will find that the points have 
              already been assigned to default recommended values.  These 
              represent an expert's opinion for the ideal point spending. 
              However, you are free to reallocate them as you wish.

              This is the recommended birth method.

***** <Standard roller>
          Standard roller
              The standard roller simply rolls three six-sided dice for each
              stat, leaving everything to chance. You can press 'r' to re-roll
              the dice, or simply accept what luck has offered.


===Character Name===

Once you have accepted a character you will asked to provide a name for 
the character.  In general, the actual choice of a name is not 
important, but do keep in mind that it may have some effect on the game 
itself.  For example, on some machines, the character name determines 
the filename that will be used to save the character to disk.  The 
character name is used on the high score list.

You can play a dynasty of characters. If you use a roman numeral at the 
end of your character name (like "Fred I" or "Pimplesnarg XVI"), the 
game will automatically update the numeral each time you die.
