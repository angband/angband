Inline help parser syntax
=========================

Text should be written in order to look good both as RST converted to
HTML/LaTeX and as plain text run through the Angband inline-help
interpreter. Proper RST escaping for the inline-help interpreter is still
not provided, but a tentative syntax is as follows:

- colons (``|``) should be ignored
- paragraphs starting with ``..`` should be ignored (including their 
  trailing blank line)
- |slashspace| should be ignored
- ``\\`` should be converted to a single backslash
- the interpreter may recognize link targets (``.. _something``) and be
  able to open a file to the right position using them.

.. |slashspace| unicode:: ``\ ``
