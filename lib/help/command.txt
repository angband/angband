=== Command Descriptions ===

The following command descriptions are listed as the command name plus 
the default key to use it. For those who prefer the original "roguelike" 
keyset, the name and key of the roguelike command is also shown if it is 
different.  Then comes a brief description of the command, including 
information about alternative methods of specifying the command in each 
keyset, when needed.

Some commands use the "repeat count" to automatically repeat the command 
several times, while others use the "repeat count" to specify a 
"quantity" for the command, and still others use it as an "argument" of 
some kind.  There is an option to "always_repeat" certain commands - 
please see the options help file.

Most commands take no "energy" to perform, while other commands only 
take energy when they cause the world to change in some way.  For 
example, attempting to read a scroll while blind does not use any 
energy.


--- Inventory Commands ---

Inventory list (i)
        Displays a list of objects being carried but not equipped.  You
        can carry up to 23 different items, not counting those in your
        equipment.  Often, many identical objects can be "stacked" into
        a "pile" which will count as a single item.  This is always
        true of things like potions, scrolls, and food, but you may have
        to set options to allow wands, staves, and other such objects to
        stack.  Each object has a weight, and if you carry more objects
        than your strength permits, you will begin to slow down.  The amount 
        of weight you can still carry without being overencumbered, or the 
        amount of extra weight you are currently carrying is displayed at 
        the top of the screen.
 
Equipment list (e)
        Use this command to display a list of the objects currently being
        used by your character.  Your character has 12 slots for equipment 
        and 10 slots for ammunition (the quiver).  Each equipment slot 
        corresponds to a different location on the body, and each of
        which may contain only a single object at a time, and each of which
        may only contain objects of the proper "type", and which include
        WIELD (weapon), BOW (missile launcher), LEFT (ring), RIGHT (ring),
        NECK (amulet), LIGHT (light source), BODY (armor), OUTER (cloak),
        ARM (shield), HEAD (helmet), HANDS (gloves), FEET (boots).  You
        must be wielding/wearing certain objects to take advantage of
        their special powers.

Drop an item (d)
        This drops an item from your inventory or equipment onto the
        dungeon floor.  If the floor spot you are standing on already has
        an object in it, Angband will attempt to drop the item onto an
        adjacent space.  Be warned that if the floor is full and you
        attempt to drop something, it may disappear and be destroyed.
        Doors and traps are considered objects for the purpose of
        determining if the space is occupied.  This command may take
        a quantity, and takes some energy.

Destroy an item (k) or Destroy an item (^D)
        This destroys an item in your inventory or on the dungeon floor.
        If the selected pile contains multiple objects, you may specify
        a quantity.  You must always (currently) verify this command.
        This command may take a quantity, and takes some energy.

Wear/Wield equipment (w)
        To wear or wield an object in your inventory, use this command.
        Since only one object can be in each slot at a time, if you wear
        or wield an item into a slot which is already occupied, the old
        item will be first be taken off, and may in fact be dropped if
        there is no room for it in your inventory.  Wielding ammunition 
        will add it to an empty slot in your quiver and prompt you to 
        replace a type of ammunition if your quiver is already full.  
        This command takes some energy.

Take off equipment (t) or Take off equipment (T)
        Use this command to take off a piece of equipment and return it
        to your inventory.  Occasionally, you will run into a cursed item
        which cannot be removed.  These items normally penalize you in some
        way and cannot be taken off until the curse is removed.  If there
        is no room in your inventory for the item, your pack will overflow
        and you will drop the item after taking it off.  You may also remove
        ammunition from your quiver with this command.  This command takes
        some energy.

--- Movement Commands ---

Moving (arrow keys, number keys) or (arrow keys, number keys and 'yuhjklbn')
	  This causes you to move one step in a given direction.  If the
	  square you wish to move into is occupied by a monster, you will
	  attack it.  If the square is occupied by a door or a trap you may
	  attempt to open or disarm it if the appropriate option is set.
	  Preceeding this command with CTRL will cause you to attack in the
	  appropriate direction, but will not move your character if no monster
	  is there.  These commands take some energy.

Walk (with pickup) (;)
        Moves one step in the given direction.  The square you are moving
        into must not be blocked by walls or doors.  You will pick up any
        items in the destination grid if the "always_pickup" option is set.
        You may also use the "original" direction keys (both keysets) or
        the "roguelike" direction keys (roguelike keyset) to walk in a
        direction.  This command may take a count, requires a direction,
        and takes some energy.

Walk (W)
        The walk command lets you willingly walk into a trap or a closed door,
        without trying to open or disarm it.  This command may take a count,
        requires a direction, and takes some energy.

Run (.) or Run (,)
        This command will move in the given direction, following any bends
        in the corridor, until you either have to make a "choice" between
        two directions or you are disturbed.  You can configure what will
        disturb you by setting the disturbance options.  You may also use
        shift plus the "roguelike" direction keys (roguelike keyset), or
        shift plus the "original" direction keys on the keypad (both keysets,
        some machines) to run in a direction.  This command may take an
        argument, requires a direction, and takes some energy.

Go up staircase (<)
        Climbs up an up staircase you are standing on.  There is always at
        least one staircase going up on every level except for the town
        level (this doesn't mean it's easy to find).  Going up a staircase
        will take you to a new dungeon level unless you are at 50 feet
        (dungeon level 1), in which case you will return to the town
        level.  Note that whenever you leave a level (not the town), you
        will never find it again.  This means that for all intents and
        purposes, any objects on that level are destroyed.  This includes
        artifacts unless the "Create characters in preserve mode" option
        was set when your character was created, in which case the artifacts
        may show up again later.  This command takes some energy.

Go down staircase (>)
        Descends a down staircase you are standing on.  There are always
        at least two staircases going down on each level, except for the
        town which has only one, and "quest" levels, which have none until
        the quest monster is killed.  Going down a staircase will take you
        to a new dungeon level.  See "Go Up Staircase" for more info.
        This command takes some energy.

--- Resting Commands ---

Stay still (with pickup) (,) or Stay still (with pickup) (.)
        Stays in the same square for one move.  If you normally pick up
        objects you encounter, you will pick up whatever you are standing
        on.  You may also use the "5" key (both keysets).  This command
        may take a count, and takes some energy.

Get objects (g)
        Pick up objects and gold on the floor beneath you.  Picking up
        gold takes no time, and objects take 1/10th of a normal turn each
        (maximum time cost is a full turn).  You may pick up objects until
        the floor is empty or your backpack is full.

Rest (R)
        Resting is better for you than repeatedly staying still, and can
        be told to automatically stop after a certain amount of time, or
        when various conditions are met.  In any case, you always wake up
        when anything disturbing happens, or when you press any key.  To
        rest, enter the Rest command, followed by the number of turns you
        want to rest, or "*" to rest until your hitpoints and mana are
        restored, or "&" to rest until you are fully "healed".  This command
        may take an argument (used for the number of turns to rest), and
        takes some energy.

--- Searching Commands ---

Search (s)
        This command can be used to locate hidden traps and secret doors
        in the spaces adjacent to the player.  More than a single turn of
        searching will be required in most cases, so it is affected by the
        'always repeat' option.  You should always search a chest before 
        trying to open it, since they are generally trapped.  This command 
        can take a count, which is useful if you are fairly sure of finding 
        something eventually, since the command stops as soon as anything 
        is found.  This command takes some energy.

Toggle search mode (S) or Toggle search mode (#)
        This command will take you into and out of search mode.  When
        first pressed, the message "Searching" will appear at the bottom
        of the screen.  You are now taking two turns for each command, one
        for the command and one turn to search.  This means that you are
        taking twice the time to move around the dungeon, and therefore
        twice the food.  Search mode will automatically turn off if you
        are disturbed.  You may also turn off search mode by entering the
        Search Mode command again.

--- Alter Commands ---

Tunnel (T) or Tunnel (^T)
        Tunnelling or mining is a very useful art.  There are many kinds of
        rock, with varying hardness, including permanent rock (permanent),
        granite (very hard), quartz veins (hard), magma veins (soft), and
        rubble (very soft).  Quartz and Magma veins may be displayed in a
        special way, and may sometimes contain treasure, in which case they
        will be displayed in a different way.  Rubble sometimes covers an
        object.  It is hard to tunnel unless you are wielding a heavy weapon
        or a shovel or a pick.  Tunnelling ability increases with strength
        and weapon weight.  This command may take a count, is affected by
        the "always_repeat" option, requires a direction, and takes some
        energy.

Open a door or chest (o)
        To open an object such as a door or chest, you must use this
        command.  If the object is locked, you will attempt to pick the
        lock based on your disarming ability.  If you open a trapped chest
        without disarming the traps first, the trap will be set off.  Some
        doors will be jammed shut and may have to be forced open.  Opening 
        will automatically attempt to pick any lock doors.  You may
        need several tries to open a door or chest.  This command may take
        a count, is affected by the "always_repeat" option, requires a
        direction, and takes some energy.

Close a door (c)
        Non-intelligent and some other creatures cannot open doors, so
        shutting doors can be quite valuable.  Furthermore, monsters cannot
        see you behind closed doors, so closing doors may allow you to buy
        some time without being attacked.  Broken doors cannot be closed.
        Bashing a door open may break it.  This command may take a count,
        is affected by the "always_repeat" option, requires a direction, and 
        takes some energy.

Jam a door (j) or Spike a door (S)
        Many monsters can simply open closed doors, and can eventually
        get through a locked door.  You may therefore occasionally want
        to jam a door shut with iron spikes.  Each spike used on the door
        will make it harder to bash down the door, up to a certain limit.
        Smaller monsters are less able to bash down doors.  In order to
        use this command, you must be carrying iron spikes.  This command
        requires a direction, and takes some energy.

Bash a door (B) or Force a door (f)
        This command allows you to bash down jammed doors.  Your bashing
        ability increases with strength.  Bashing open a door can (briefly)
        throw you off balance.  Doors that are stuck, or which have been
        jammed closed with spikes can only be opened by bashing, and all
        closed doors can be bashed open if desired.  Bashing a door open
        may permanently break it so that it can never be closed.  This
        command may take a count, is affected by the "always_repeat" option,
        requires a direction, and takes some energy.

Disarm a trap or chest (D)
        You can attempt to disarm traps on the floor or on chests.  If you
        fail, there is a chance that you will blunder and set it off.  You
        can only disarm a trap after you have found it (usually with the
        Search command).  This command may take a count, is affected by the
        "always_repeat" option, requires a direction, and takes some energy.

Alter (+)
        This special command allows the use of a single keypress to select
        any of the "obvious" commands above (attack, tunnel, bash, open,
        disarm, close), and, by using macros or keymaps, to combine this
        keypress with directions.  In general, this allows the use of the
        "control" key plus the appropriate "direction" key (including the
        roguelike direction keys in roguelike mode) as a kind of generic
        "alter the terrain feature of an adjacent grid" command.  This
        command may take a count, is affected by the "always_repeat" option,
        requires a direction, and takes some energy.

--- Spell and Prayer Commands ---

Browse a book (b) or Peruse a book (P)
        Only mages, rogues, and rangers can read magic books, and only
        priests and paladins can read prayer books.  Warriors cannot read
        any books.  When this command is used, all of the spells or prayers
        contained in the selected book are displayed, along with information
        such as their level, the amount of mana required to cast them, and
        whether or not you know the spell or prayer.

Gain new spells or prayers (G)
        Use this command to actually learn new spells or prayers.  When you
        are able to learn new spells or prayers, the word "Study" will appear
        on the status line at the bottom of the screen.  If you have a book
        in your possession, containing spells or prayers which you may learn,
        then you may choose to study that book.  If you are a mage, rogue, or
        ranger, you may actually choose which spell to study.  If you are a
        priest or paladin, your gods will choose a prayer for you.  There are
        nine books of each type, five of which are normally found only in the
        dungeon. This command takes some energy.

Cast a spell (m)
        To cast a spell, you must have previously learned the spell and
        must have in your inventory a book from which the spell can be
        read.  Each spell has a chance of failure which starts out fairly
        large but decreases as you gain levels.  If you don't have enough
        mana to cast a spell, you will be prompted for confirmation.  If
        you decide to go ahead, the chance of failure is greatly increased,
        and you may wind up paralyzed for several turns.  Since you must read
        the spell from a book, you cannot be blind or confused while casting,
        and there must be some light present.  This command takes some energy:
        the higher your level, the less it takes, but the higher the spell
        level, the more it takes. 

Pray a prayer (p)
        To pray effectively, you must have previously learned the prayer
        and must have in your inventory a book from which the prayer can
        be read.  Each prayer has a chance of being ignored which starts
        out fairly large but decreases as you gain levels.  If you don't
        have enough mana to cast a spell, you will be prompted for
        confirmation.  If you decide to go ahead, the chance of failure
        is greatly increased, and you may lose a point of constitution.
        Since you must read the prayer from a book, you cannot be blind
        or confused while praying, and there must be some light present.
        This command takes some energy - as with spells, higher caster
        level means less energy used, but higher spell level means more. 

--- Object Manipulation Commands ---

Eat some food (E)
        You must eat regularly to prevent starvation.  As you grow hungry,
        a message will appear at the bottom of the screen saying "Hungry".
        If you go hungry long enough, you will become weak, then start
        fainting, and eventually, you may will die of starvation.  You
        may use this command to eat food in your inventory.  Note that
        you can sometimes find food in the dungeon, but it is not always
        wise to eat strange food.  This command takes some energy.

Fuel your lantern/torch (F)
        If you are using a torch and have more torches in your pack,
        or you are using a lantern and have flasks of oil in your pack,
        then your can "refuel" them with this command.  Torches and Lanterns
        are limited in their maximal fuel.  In general, two flasks will fully
        fuel a lantern and two torches will fully fuel a torch.  This command
        takes some energy.

Quaff a potion (q)
        Use this command to drink a potion.  Potions affect the player in
        various ways, but the effects are not always immediately obvious. 
        This command takes some energy.

Read a scroll (r)
        Use this command to read a scroll.  Scroll spells usually have an
        area effect, except for a few cases where they act on other objects.
        Reading a scroll causes the parchment to disintegrate as the scroll
        takes effect.  Most scrolls which prompt for more information can be
        aborted (by pressing escape), which will stop reading the scroll
        before it disintegrates.  This command takes some energy.
 
Inscribe an object ({) 
        This command inscribes a string on an object.  The inscription is
        displayed inside curly braces after the object description.  The
        inscription is limited to the particular object (or pile) and is
        not automatically transferred to all similar objects.  Under certain
        circumstances, Angband will display "fake" inscriptions on certain
        objects ("cursed", "broken", "tried", "empty", "NN% off") when
        appropriate.  These "fake" inscriptions remain all the time, even if 
        the player chooses to add a "real" inscription on top of it later.

        In addition, Angband will occasionally place a "real" inscription on
        an object for you, normally as the result of your character getting
        a "feeling" about the item.  All characters will get "feelings" about
        weapons and armor after carrying them for a while.  Warriors (who 
        understand weapons and armor best) get the most detailed feelings, 
        and get them faster than other classes. Rogues (used to handling all 
        sorts of stolen goods) are also very good, as are paladins (basically
        warriors who are religious.) Rangers are not so well-versed in 
        melee weapons, being normally people of the outdoors and the 
        wilderness who prefer archery and camouflage to heavy metal armor and
        weaponry, while priests and mages simply are not experienced enough 
        in matters concerning melee to be able to tell much about an item - 
        though a priest will realise the extent of his knowledge fairly 
        quickly, as they are often called upon to fight for their faith and 
        have learned a little from these experiences and divine insight.
        Mages, frankly, haven't a clue. But then, they don't need it when 
        they can learn the spell of Identify very early on in the game.

        An item labeled as "{empty}" was found to be out of charges, and an
        item labeled as "{tried}" is a "flavored" item which the character
        has used, but whose effects are unknown.  Certain inscriptions have
        a meaning to the game, see "@#", "@x#", "!*", and "!x", in the section
        on inventory object selection.

Uninscribe an object (})
        This command removes the inscription on an object.  This command will
        have no effect on "fake" inscriptions added by the game itself.

--- Magical Object Commands ---

Activate an artifact (A)
        You have heard rumors of special weapons and armor deep in the
        Pits, items that can let you breathe fire like a dragon or light
        rooms with just a thought.  Should you ever be lucky enough to
        find such an item, this command will let you activate its special
        ability.  Special abilities can only be used if you are wearing or
        wielding the item.  This command takes some energy.

Aim a wand (a) or Zap a wand (z)
        Wands must be aimed in a direction to be used.  Wands are magical
        devices, and therefore there is a chance you will not be able to
        figure out how to use them if you aren't good with magical
        devices.  They will fire a shot that affects the first object or
        creature encountered or fire a beam that affects anything in a
        given direction, depending on the wand.  An obstruction such as a
        door or wall will generally stop the effects from traveling any
        farther.  This command requires a direction and can use a target.
        This command takes some energy.

Use a staff (u) or Zap a staff (Z)
        This command will use a staff.  A staff is normally very similar
        to a scroll, in that they normally either have an area effect or
        affect a specific object.  Staves are magical devices, and there
        is a chance you will not be able to figure out how to use them.
        This command takes some energy.
 
Zap a rod (z) or Activate a rod (a)
        Rods are extremely powerful magical items, which cannot be burnt
        or shattered, and which can have either staff-like or wand-like
        effects, but unlike staves and wands, they don't have charges.
        Instead, they draw on the ambient magical energy to recharge
        themselves, and therefore can only be activated once every few
        turns.  The recharging time varies depending on the type of rod.
        This command may require a direction (depending on the type of
        rod, and whether you are aware of its type) and can use a target.
        This command takes some energy.

--- Throwing and Missile Weapons ---

Fire an item (f) or Fire an item (t)
        This command will fire a will allow you to fire a missile from either
        your quiver or your inventory provided it is the appropriate 
        ammunition for the current BOW you have equipped.  You may not fire 
        an item without a BOW equipped.  Fired ammunition has a chance of 
        breaking.  This command takes some energy.

Fire default ammo at nearest (h) or (TAB)
        If you have a missile weapon equipped and the appropriate ammunition
        in your quiver, you can use this command to fire at the nearest
        visible enemy. This command will cancel itself if you lack a
        launcher, ammunition or a visible target that is in range. The 
        first ammunition of the correct type found in the quiver is used. 
        This command takes some energy.

Throw an item (v)
        You may throw any object carried by your character.  Depending on
        the weight, it may travel across the room or drop down beside you.
        Only one object from a pile will be thrown at a time.  Note that
        throwing an object will often cause it to break, so be careful!
        If you throw something at a creature, your chances of hitting it
        are determined by your pluses to hit, your ability at throwing,
        and the object's pluses to hit.  Once the creature is hit, the
        object may or may not do any damage to it.  You've heard rumors
        that some objects found in the dungeon can do huge amounts of
        damage when thrown, but you're not sure which objects those
        are....  Note that flasks of oil will do a fairly large chunk
        of damage to a monster on impact, supposedly representing fire
        damage, but it works against fire elementals too - not that it's 
        exactly worth it by that stage of dungeon exploration.  If you are
        wielding a missile launcher compatible with the object you are
        throwing, then you automatically use the launcher to fire the
        missile with much higher range, accuracy, and damage, than you
        would get by just throwing the missile.  Throw, like fire, requires
        a direction.  Targeting mode (see the next command) can be invoked
        with "*" at the "Direction?" prompt.  This command takes some energy.

Targeting Mode (*)
        This will allow you to aim your spells and such at a specific
        monster or grid, so that you can point directly towards that
        monster or grid (even if this is not a "compass" direction) when
        you are asked for a direction.  You can set a target using this
        command, or you can set a new target at the "Direction?" prompt when
        appropriate.  At the targeting prompt, you have many options.  First
        of all, targetting mode starts targetting nearby monsters which can
        be reached by "projectable" spells and thrown objects.  In this mode,
        you can press "t" (or "5" or ".") to select the current monster,
        space to advance to the next monster, "-" to back up to the previous
        monster, direction keys to advance to a monster more or less in that
        direction, "r" to "recall" the current monster, "q" to exit targetting
        mode, and "p" (or "o") to stop targetting monsters and enter the mode
        for targetting a location on the floor or in a wall.  Note that if
        there are no nearby monsters, you will automatically enter this mode.
        Note that hitting "o" is just like "p", except that the location
        cursor starts on the last examined monster instead of on the player.
        In this mode, you use the "direction" keys to move around, and the
        "q" key to quit, and the "t" (or "5" or ".") key to target the cursor
        location.  Note that targetting a location is slightly "dangerous",
        as the target is maintained even if you are far away.  To cancel an
        old target, simply hit "*" and then ESCAPE (or "q").  Note that when
        you cast a spell or throw an object at the target location, the path
        chosen is the "optimal" path towards that location, which may or may
        not be the path you want.  Sometimes, by clever choice of a location
        on the floor for your target, you may be able to convince a thrown
        object or cast spell to squeeze through a hole or corridor that is
        blocking direct access to a different grid.  Launching a ball spell
        or breath weapon at a location in the middle of a group of monsters
        can often improve the effects of that attack, since ball attacks are
        not stopped by interposed monsters if the ball is launched at a target.
        
--- Looking Commands ---

Full screen map (M)
        This command will show a map of the entire dungeon, reduced by a
        factor of nine, on the screen.  Only the major dungeon features
        will be visible because of the scale, so even some important
        objects may not show up on the map.  This is particularly useful
        in locating where the stairs are relative to your current
        position, or for identifying unexplored areas of the dungeon.

Locate player on map (L) or Where is the player (W)
        This command lets you scroll your map around, looking at all sectors
        of the current dungeon level, until you press escape, at which point
        the map will be re-centered on the player if necessary.  To scroll
        the map around, simply press any of the "direction" keys.  The top
        line will display the sector location, and the offset from your
        current sector.

Look around (l) or Examine things (x)
        This command is used to look around at nearby monsters (to determine
        their type and health) and objects (to determine their type).  It is
        also used to find out what objects (if any) are under monsters, and
        if a monster is currently inside a wall, and what is under the player.
        When you are looking at something, you may hit space for more details,
        or to advance to the next interesting monster or object, or minus ("-")
        to go back to the previous monster or object, or a direction key to
        advance to the nearest interesting monster or object (if any) in that
        general direction, or "r" to recall information about the current
        monster race, or "q" or escape to stop looking around.  You always
        start out looking at "yourself".

Inspect an item (I)
        This command lets you inspect an item. This will tell you things 
        about the special powers of the object, as well as attack information
        for weapons.  It will also tell you what resistances or abilities 
        you have noticed for the item and if you have not yet completely 
        identified all properties.
        
List visible monsters ([)
        This command lists all monsters that are visible to you, telling you
        how many there are of each kind. It also tells you whether they are 
        asleep, and where they are (relative to you). 

List visible items (])
        This command lists all items that are visible to you, telling you
        how of each there are and where they are on the level relative to your current location.

--- Message Commands ---

Repeat level feeling (^F)
        Repeats the feeling about the dungeon level that you got when you
        first entered the level.

View previous messages (^P)
        This command shows you all the recent messages.  You can scroll
        through them, or exit with ESCAPE.

Take notes (:)
        This command allows you to take notes, which will then appear in
        your message list and your character history (prefixed with "Note:").

--- Game Status Commands ---

Character Description (C)
        Brings up a full description of your character, including your
        skill levels, your current and potential stats, and various other
        information.  From this screen, you can change your name or use
        the file character description command to save your character
        status to a file.  That command saves additional information,
        including your background, your inventory, and the contents of
        your house.

Check knowledge (~)
        This command allows you to ask about the knowledge possessed by
        your character.  Currently, this includes being able to list all
        known "artifacts", "uniques", and "objects".  Normally, once an
        artifact is "generated", and "lost", it can never again be found,
        and will become "known" to the player.  With "preserve" mode, an
        artifact can never be "lost" until it is "known" to the player.
        In either case, any "known" artifacts not in the possession of
        the player will never again be "generated".  The "uniques" are
        special "unique" monsters which can only be killed once per game.
        Certain "objects" come in "flavors", and you must determine the
        effect of each "flavor" once for each such type of object, and
        this command will allow you to display all "known" flavors.  
        Inscribing items in this list will cause you to similarly 
        inscribe all similar items you find from this point on.

Interact with the system (!)
        Allow the user to interact with the underlying visual system.
        This command is currently unused.
 
--- Saving and Exiting Commands ---

Save and Quit (Ctrl-X)
        To save your game so that you can return to it later, use this
        command.  Save files will also be generated (hopefully) if the
        game crashes due to a system error.  After you die, you can use
        your savefile to play again with the same options and such.

Save (Ctrl-S)
        This command saves the game but doesn't exit Angband.  Use this
        frequently if you are paranoid about having your computer crash
        (or your power go out) while you are playing.

Quit (commit suicide) (Q)
        Kills your character and exits Angband.  You will be prompted to
        make sure you really want to do this, and then asked to verify
        that choice.  Note that dead characters are dead forever.

--- User pref file commands ---

Interact with options (=)
        Allow you to interact with options.  Note that using the "cheat"
        options may mark your savefile as unsuitable for the high score
        list.  You may change normal options using the "X" and "Y" user
        pref commands.  The "window" options allow you to specify what
        should be drawn in any of the special sub-windows (not available
        on all platforms). See the help file "options.txt" for more info.
        You can also interact with macros and keymaps under this menu.

Interact with macros - option submenu
        Allow you to interact with macros.  You may load or save macros
        from user pref files, create macros of various types, or define
        keymaps.  You must define a "current action", shown at the bottom
        of the screen, before you attempt to use any of the "create macro"
        commands, which use that "current action" as their action.  This
        is a horrible interface, and will be fixed eventually.

Interact with visuals - option submenu.
        Allow you to interact with visuals.  You may load or save visuals
        from user pref files, or modify the attr/char mappings for the
        monsters, objects, and terrain features.  You must use the "redraw"
        command (^R) to redraw the map after changing attr/char mappings.
        NOTE: It is generally easier to modify visuals via the "knowledge"
        menus.

Interact with colors - option submenu.
        Allow the user to interact with colors.  This command only
        works on some systems.
        NOTE: It is commonly used to brighten the 'Light Dark' color
        (eg. Cave Spiders) on displays with bad alpha settings.
 
--- Help ---

Help (?)
        Brings up the Angband on-line help system.  Note that the help
        files are just text files in a particular format, and that other
        help files may be available on the Net.  In particular, there are
        a variety of spoiler files which do not come with the standard
        distribution.  Check the place you got Angband from or ask on the
        newsgroup rec.games.roguelike.angband about them. 

Identify Symbol (/)
        Use this command to find out what a character stands for.  For
        instance, by pressing "/.", you can find out that the "." symbol
        stands for a floor spot.  When used with a symbol that represents
        creatures, the this command will tell you only what class of
        creature the symbol stands for, not give you specific information
        about a creature you can see.  To get that, use the Look command.

        There are three special symbols you can use with the Identify
        Symbol command to access specific parts of your monster memory.
        Typing Ctrl-A when asked for a symbol will recall details about
        all monsters, typing Ctrl-U will recall details about all unique
        monsters, and typing Ctrl-N will recall details about all
        non-unique monsters.

        If the character stands for a creature, you are asked if you want
        to recall details.  If you answer yes, information about the
        creatures you have encountered with that symbol is shown in the
        Recall window if available, or on the screen if not.  You can also
        answer "k" to see the list sorted by number of kills, or "p" to
        see the list sorted by dungeon level the monster is normally found
        on.  Pressing ESCAPE at any point will exit this command.

Game Version (V)
        This command will tell you what version of Angband you are using.
        For more information, see the "version.txt" help file.

Command lists (Enter)
        This brings up a little window in the middle of the screen, in which
        you can select what command you would like to use by browsing. 
        Useful for beginners.

--- Extra Commands ---

Toggle Choice Window (^E) 
        Toggles the display in any sub-windows (if available) which are
        displaying your inventory or equipment.

Redraw Screen (^R)
        This command adapts to various changes in global options, and
        redraws all of the windows.  It is normally only necessary in
        abnormal situations, such as after changing the visual attr/char
        mappings, or enabling "graphics" mode.

Load screen dump (left-paren)
        This command loads a "snap-shot" of the current screen from the file
        "dump.txt", and displays it on the screen.

Save screen dump (right-paren)
        This command dumps a "snap-shot" of the current screen to the file
        "dump.txt", including encoded color information.  The command has
        three variants:
        - text, a simple ascii dump of the screen concatenated with a dump of
        the color attributes.  It may be viewed in color with the '(' command.
        - html, suitable for viewing in a web browser.
        - forum embedded html for vBulletin, suitable for pasting in
        web forums like http://angband.oook.cz/forums.
