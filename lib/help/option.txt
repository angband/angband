=== Option Descriptions ===

Most of the "options" are accessible through the '=' command, which provides
an interface to the various "sets" of options available to the player.

In the decriptions below, each option is listed as the textual summary
which is shown on the "options" screen, plus the internal name of the
option in brackets, followed by a textual description of the option.

Note that the internal name of the option can be used in user pref files
to force the option to a given setting, see "command.txt" for more info.

Various concepts are mentioned in the descriptions below, including "disturb",
(cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands, which are in progress),
"flush" (forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress queue, including any
macros in progress), "fresh" (dump any pending output to the screen), and
"sub-windows" (see below).


=== User Interface options ===

***** <rogue_like_commands>
Rogue-like commands    [rogue_like_commands]
    Selects the "roguelike" command set (see "command.txt" for info).

***** <quick_messages>
Activate quick messages    [quick_messages]
    Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the "-more-" prompt
    (useful for monster farming).  Allows most keys to mean "no" to any
    "[y/n]" prompt.

***** <floor_query_flag>
Prompt for floor item selection    [floor_query_flag]
    Allows the user to select objects from the center of stacks.  Without
    this option, the uppermost appropriate object will always be selected.

***** <carry_query_flag>
Prompt before picking things up    [carry_query_flag]
    Forces the game to ask your permission before allowing you to pick up
    any object.

***** <use_old_target>
Use old target by default    [use_old_target]
    Forces all commands which normally ask for a "direction" to use the
    current "target" if there is one.  Use of this option can be dangerous
    if you target locations on the ground, unless you clear them when done.

***** <always_pickup>
Pick things up by default    [always_pickup]
    Tells the game that walking onto an item should attempt to pick it up.
    Picking up objects in the manner takes no additional energy.  Note the
    "g" and "-" commands, which can be used to "reverse" this option for a
    single turn.

***** <always_repeat>
Repeat obvious commands    [always_repeat]
    Tells the game that when you attempt to "open" a door or chest, "bash"
    a door, "tunnel" through walls, "disarm" traps or chests, or "alter"
    any grid, that you wish to automatically "repeat" the command 99 times
    (see "command.txt"), unless an explicit repeat count was given.

***** <stack_force_notes>
Merge inscriptions when stacking    [stack_force_notes]
    Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if one has an empty
    inscription and the other does not.  The resulting stack keeps the 
    non-empty inscription.

***** <stack_force_costs>
Merge discounts when stacking    [stack_force_costs]
    Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if they have different
    discounts.  The resulting stack keeps the largest discount.  This option
    may cause you to lose "value", but will give you optimal pack usage.

***** <ring_bell>
Audible bell (on errors, etc)    [ring_bell]
    Attempt to make a "bell" noise when various "errors" occur.

***** <easy_open>
Open/Disarm/Close without direction    [easy_open]
    If there is only one closed door next to the character, the game will 
    not bother asking for a direction when the player asks to "o"pen 
    something. The same applies for "c"losing doors and "D"isarming traps.

***** <easy_alter>
Open/Disarm doors/traps on movement.    [easy_alter]
     Moving into a closed door will attempt once to open it, and moving 
     into a trap will attempt once to disarm it. If the player ever wishes
     to leave a known teleport trap as a guaranteed escape route, this 
     option must therefore be off.

***** <easy_floor>
Display floor stacks in a list    [easy_floor]
     When moving into a stack, if this option is *off*, the character will 
     attempt to pick up items from the stack, from top to bottom, until the 
     stack is gone or the inventory is full. This option allows the player
     to interact with other items than the one at the top of the stack.

***** <scroll_target>
Scroll map while targetting    [scroll_target]
     This allows the player to target monsters which are off-screen from the
     player's point of view, as the view will scroll to show the whereabouts
     of all monsters in line of sight so the player can target them.


=== Disturbance options ===

***** <run_ignore_stairs>
Run past stairs    [run_ignore_stairs]
    Ignore stairs when running.

***** <run_ignore_doors>
Run through open doors    [run_ignore_doors]
    Ignore open doors when running.

***** <run_cut_corners>
Run past known corners    [run_cut_corners]
    Cut sharply around "known" corners when running.  This will result in
    "faster" running, but may cause you to run into a "lurking" monster.

***** <run_use_corners>
Run into potential corners    [run_use_corners]
    Fully explore "potential corners" in hallways.

***** <disturb_move>
Disturb whenever any monster moves    [disturb_move]
    Disturb the player when any monster moves, appears, or disappears.
    This includes monsters which are only visible due to telepathy, so
    you should probably turn this option off if you want to "rest" near
    such monsters.

***** <disturb_near>
Disturb whenever viewable monster moves    [disturb_near]
    Disturb the player when any viewable monster moves, whenever any
    monster becomes viewable for the first time, and also whenever any
    viewable monster becomes no longer viewable.  This option ignores
    the existance of "telepathy" for the purpose of determining whether
    a monster is "viewable".  See also the "view_reduce_view" option.

***** <disturb_panel>
Disturb whenever map panel changes    [disturb_panel]
    This option causes you to be disturbed by the screen "scrolling",
    as it does when you get close to the "edge" of the screen.

***** <disturb_state>
Disturb whenever player state changes    [disturb_state]
    This option causes you to be disturbed whenever the player state
    changes, including changes in hunger, resistance, confusion, etc.

***** <disturb_minor>
Disturb whenever boring things happen    [disturb_minor]
    This option causes you to be disturbed by various bring things,
    including monsters bashing down doors, inventory feelings, and
    beginning to run out of fuel.

***** <alert_failure>
Alert user to various failures    [alert_failure]
    Produce a "bell" noise, and flush all pending input, when various
    "failures" occur, as described above.

***** <verify_destroy>
Verify destruction of objects    [verify_destroy]
    Prompt for verification of the "destroy" command.

***** <verify_special>
Verify use of special commands    [verify_special]
    Prompt for verification of the "special" commands (borg and debug).

***** <allow_quantity>
Allow quantity specification    [allow_quantity]
    Prompt for a quantity when necessary, instead of defaulting to a
    single object.

***** <auto_more>
Automatically clear -more- prompts    [auto_more]
    The game does not wait for a keypress when it comes to a -more-
    prompt, but carries on going.


=== Game-play options ===

***** <auto_haggle>
Auto-haggle in stores    [auto_haggle]
    Disable "haggling" in stores, resulting in a ten percent sales tax
    on items which you would have otherwise been forced to haggle for.
    When this option is on, all prices listed in stores will be the
    actual price that you pay for an item, as opposed to the price
    that the shop-keeper will suggest.

***** <auto_scum>
Auto-scum for good levels    [auto_scum]
    This is a hack but allows you to force the generation of "good" levels
    in the dungeon.  This option may be extremely slow on some machines,
    especially deep in the dungeon.  The minimum "goodness" of the level
    is based on the dungeon level, so the deeper you go, the better the
    level will be.  A lot of people consider this option to be cheating.

***** <expand_look>
Expand the power of the look command    [expand_look]
    Expand the "look" command to allow the user to "look" at grids which
    are not actually in view of the player, allowing the examination of
    objects/monsters which have only been detected by spells, or sensed
    via telepathy.

***** <expand_list>
Expand the power of the list commands    [expand_list]
    Expand the "listing" commands so that they "wrap" at the "edges" of
    the appropriate list.  This allows the "look" and "target" commands
    to "cycle" through all appropriate grids forever, and the "identify
    symbol" to browse through all of the monsters of a given type.

***** <view_perma_grids>
Map remembers all perma-lit grids    [view_perma_grids]
    Memorize all perma-lit floor grids which are seen by the player.
    This option allows you to keep track of which explored floor grids
    were perma-lit, but does not distinguish between dark floor grids,
    unexplored floor grids, and unknown grids.  Turning off this option
    allows the player to always know which lit floor grids are in line
    of sight, but this is better accomplished by the "view_bright_lite"
    option.  Note that any non-floor grids which is seen by the player
    are always memorized, and "object" which is seen by the player is
    memorized independantly from the memorization of the grid itself.

***** <view_torch_grids>
Map remembers all torch-lit grids    [view_torch_grids]
    Memorize all (torch-lit) floor grids which are seen by the player.
    This option not only allows you to keep track of which floor grids
    have been explored, but also which ones are "dark", because the use
    of this option activates a special "color scheme" for the display of
    floor grids, in which "dark" grids are drawn in "dark gray", "lit"
    grids are drawn in "white", and (if the "view_bright_lite" option is
    set) "lit" grids which are also in line of sight are drawn in "orange".
    Note that grids which are currently "torch-lit" are considered to be
    "lit", and are thus drawn in "white", unless the "view_yellow_lite"
    option is set, in which case they are drawn in "yellow".

***** <dungeon_align>
Generate dungeons with aligned rooms    [dungeon_align]
    Force all rooms to be "aligned" with the "panel" divisions.  This results
    in a much "prettier" dungeon, but may result in fewer greater vaults.

***** <dungeon_stair>
Generate dungeons with connected stairs    [dungeon_stair]
    Always generate a staircase back to the level you came from, if you used
    a staircase to get to the level.  This is more "realistic", and "safer",
    but less of a "challenge" for some people.

***** <flow_by_sound>
Monsters chase current location (v.slow)    [flow_by_sound]
    Allow monsters to make paths to the player when they are nearby.  This
    option is extremely slow, but can produce viciously smart monsters.

***** <flow_by_smell>
Monsters chase recent locations (v.slow)    [flow_by_smell]
    Allow monsters to take advantage of "old" trails that you may have left
    in the dungeon.  This has no effect unless "flow_by_sound" is also set.

***** <smart_monsters>
Monsters behave more intelligently     [smart_monsters]
     Monsters have a certain amount of intelligence and will use it - 
     teleporting away when low on hit points, using their more powerful
     spells in preference to the less powerful spells, etc. Not all 
     monsters are, of course, intelligent.

***** <smart_packs>
Monsters act smarter in groups    [smart_packs]
     "group" monsters will use tactics that groups of monsters might 
     reasonably employ - such as hiding out of sight around a corner, 
     trying to draw the character out into the middle of a room so they 
     can surround him and all attack at once, rather than chasing one
     by one down a corridor.

***** <smart_learn>
Monsters learn from their mistakes    [smart_learn]
    Allow monsters to learn what spell attacks you are resistant to,
    and to use this information to choose the best attacks.

***** <smart_cheat>
Monsters exploit players weaknesses    [smart_cheat]
    Allow monsters to know what spell attacks you are resistant to,
    and to use this information to choose the best attacks.


=== Efficiency options ===

***** <view_reduce_lite>
Reduce lite-radius when running    [view_reduce_lite]
    Reduce the "radius" of the player's "lite" to that of a "torch"
    when the player is "running", which makes running more "efficient",
    but is extremely annoying.

***** <hidden_player>
Hide player symbol when running    [hidden_player]
    Hide the player symbol when the player is "running", which makes the
    game somewhat faster.

***** <avoid_abort>
Avoid checking for user abort    [avoid_abort]
    Avoid checking to see if the user has pressed a key during resting
    or running or repeated commands.  This not only makes the game much
    more efficient (on many systems), but also allows the use of certain
    obscure macro sequences, such as turning this option on, resting until
    done, turning this option off, and casting a spell.  Note that the use
    of this option may be dangerous on certain "graphic" machines.  Resting
    for long periods of time with this option set is dangerous since the
    resting may not stop until the user takes damage from starvation.

***** <avoid_other>
Avoid processing special colors    [avoid_other]
    Avoid processing the "multi-hued" or "clear" attributes of monsters.
    This will cause all "multi-hued" monsters to appear "violet" and all
    "clear" monsters to appear "white", and will cause "trappers" and
    "lurkers" to be visible on some machines, but it may greatly increase
    efficiency especially when telepathy is active.  Certain systems may
    choose to set this option if they are unable to support the special
    "color" processing, but if they handle graphics "correctly", by using
    attr/char pairs with the "high bits" set, then not only will the game
    correctly avoid using any "dangerous" color processing, but it will
    allow such processing to occur when it is not dangerous.  So if you
    are using graphics, and you use a "normal" attr/char for the "floor"
    grids, then you can use the "special lighting effects" for floors.

***** <flush_failure>
Flush input on various failures    [flush_failure]
    This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever various
    "failures" occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure to use a wand,
    etc.  This is very useful if you use macros which include "directional"
    components with commands that can fail, since it will prevent you from
    walking towards monsters when your spells fail.

***** <flush_disturb>
Flush input whenever disturbed    [flush_disturb]
    This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever the
    character is "disturbed".  This is useful if you use macros which take
    time, since it will prevent you from continuing your macro while being
    attacked by a monster.

***** <fresh_before>
Flush output before every command    [fresh_before]
    This option forces the game to flush all output before every command.
    This will give you maximal information, but may slow down the game
    somewhat.  Note that this option is only useful when using macros,
    resting, running, or repeating commands, since the outout is always
    flushed when the game is waiting for a keypress from the user.

***** <fresh_after>
Flush output after certain things    [fresh_after]
    This option forces the game to flush all output after not only every
    player command, but also after every round of processing monsters and
    objects, and after every message, which will maximize your information,
    but may slow down the game a lot, especially on slower machines, and on
    faster machines you cannot see the results anyway.

***** <compress_savefile>
Compress messages in savefiles    [compress_savefile]
    Compress the savefile, by only saving the most recent "messages" that
    the player has received.  This can cut the size of the savefile by a
    drastic amount, but will result in the loss of message information.


=== Display options ===

***** <depth_in_feet>
Show dungeon level in feet    [depth_in_feet]
    Display dungeon depths in "feet" instead of "levels".

***** <show_labels>
Show labels in equipment listings    [show_labels]
    Display "labels" (what an object is being used for) for objects in all
    "equipment" listings.

***** <show_weights>
Show weights in all object listings    [show_weights]
    Display "weights" (in pounds) of objects in all "inventory", "equipment",
    "store items", and "home items" listings.

***** <show_choices>
Show choices in inven/equip listings    [show_choices]
    Display "choices" (legal responses) in any sub-windows which are being
    used to display your inventory or equipment.  Also, if one sub-window
    is being used to display your inventory or equipment, then this option
    will cause it to be (temporarily) toggled as needed to always show the
    "appropriate" set of objects (inventory or equipment).

***** <show_details>
Show details in monster descriptions    [show_details]
    Display "details" (including number of monsters killed, and textual
    descriptions) in monster descriptions.
    are displaying the monster.

***** <show_flavors>
Show flavors in object descriptions    [show_flavors]
    Display "flavors" (color or variety) in object descriptions, even for
    objects whose type is known.  This does not affect objects in stores.

***** <hilite_player>
Hilite the player with the cursor    [hilite_player]
    Place the visible cursor on the player.  This looks fine on some Unix
    machines, but horrible on most graphics machines.  Note that only some
    machines are able to *not* show the cursor, but on those machines, hiding
    the cursor often speeds up the game and looks better.

***** <view_yellow_lite>
Use special colors for torch-lit grids    [view_yellow_lite]
    This option causes special colors to be used for "torch-lit" grids in
    certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and "view_special_lite").
    Turning this option off will slightly improve game speed.

***** <view_bright_lite>
Use special colors for 'viewable' grids    [view_bright_lite]
    This option causes special colors to be used for non "viewable" grids
    in certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and "view_special_lite").
    When this option is set, floor grids which are normally drawn in "white"
    but which are not currently "viewable" by the player are instead drawn
    in "dark gray".  This makes the "viewable" grids to appear "brighter"
    than the others, allowing the player to easily determine which floor
    grids are in "line of sight".  Turning this option off will probably
    increase the speed of the game.

***** <view_granite_lite>
Use special colors for wall grids (slow)    [view_granite_lite]
    This option activates a special color scheme for all "wall" grids which
    are normally drawn in "white" (as walls and rubble normally are).  When
    the player is blind, we use "dark gray", else if the grid is torch-lit,
    we use "yellow" (or "white") depending on the "view_yellow_lite" option,
    else if the "view_bright_lite" option is set, and the grid is not in line
    of sight, or the grid is dark, or the grid is only "partially" lit, then
    we use "gray", otherwise we use the normal "white".  Turning this option
    off will probably increase the speed of the game.  This option may not
    work well if the attr/char codes for walls/veins have been changed, or
    if "graphics" are being used.

***** <view_special_lite>
Use special colors for floor grids (slow)    [view_special_lite]
    This option activates a special color scheme for all "floor" grids which
    are normally drawn in "white" (as they normally are).  When the player is
    blind, we use "dark gray", else if the grid is torch-lit, we use "yellow"
    (or "white") depending on the "view_yellow_lite" option, else if the grid
    is "dark", we use "dark gray", else if the "view_bright_lite" option is
    set, and the grid is not in line of sight, we use "gray", otherwise we
    use the normal "white".  Turning this option off will probably increase
    the speed of the game.  This option may not work well if the attr/char
    codes for walls/veins have been changed, or if "graphics" are being used.

***** <center_player>
Center map continuously (very slow)    [center_player]
     The map always centres on the player with this option on. With it off, it
     is divided into 25 sections, with coordinates (0,0) to (4,4), and will 
     show one section at a time.

***** <run_avoid_center>
Avoid centering while running    [run_avoid_center]
     The map does not centre on the player if the player moves with the "run" 
     command, only when the running finishes.

***** <show_piles>
Show stacks using special attr/character     [show_piles]
     Stacks of items on the floor are shown using the "&" symbol.


=== Birth options ===

***** <birth_point_based>
Allow purchase of stats using points    [birth_point_based]
     This allows the player to set, point by point, his own preferred stats 
     the character, rather than rolling at random, when creating a character.

***** <birth_auto_roller>
Allow specification of minimum stats    [birth_auto_roller]
     This allows the player to set minimum stats (within reason) and ask 
     the game to keep on rolling until a character with the desired stats
     is generated. It is generally believed that a single stat can be got 
     higher with point-based generation, but the overall total of all the 
     will be higher when rolling randomly (including with the auto-roller.)

***** <birth_maximize>
Maximize effect of race/class bonuses    [birth_maximize]
     Normally, if a character should find potions that permanently increase
     his stats, the maximum that can be achieved without equipment bonuses 
     is 18/100. If maximize mode is on (which is the default), then the race
     and class bonuses and penalties apply to this limit, so your half-troll 
     will have a greater maximum possible strength (unassisted by his 
     equipment) than a hobbit. With maximize mode off, all characters max 
     out at 18/100 for all stats. This also affects the start of the game, 
     because race and class bonuses are applied as if they were "rings" in 
     maximize mode (at an exact rate of 0/10 percentile points equals 1 point
     for stats over 18), and as "potions" in non-maximize mode (drinking six
     potions of [stat] will probably increase your stat by more than 0/60 if 
     it was at 18 to start with.) To cut a long story short and a confusing 
     explanation simple, you get better starting stats in non-maximize mode,
     but can't get as good at what you're supposed to be best at in the later 
     stages of the game.

***** <birth_preserve>
Preserve artifacts on leaving level    [birth_preserve]
     If preserve mode is "off", you can get a level feeling that you *NEVER*
     get with preserve mode "on": a "special" feeling. This means that there 
     is an artifact, a pit or a vault on the level: and while a pit or vault
     may not necessarily cause a special feeling, an artifact CERTAINLY will.
     This is principally of use in finding out which levels are *not* 
     "special", i.e. which ones can be left in a hurry without worrying 
     about leaving something behind - if it's not "special", there is no 
     artifact unless a monster has dropped one when you killed it. This is 
     particularly important because, with preserve mode off, no artifact can
     be generated more than once in the game. If it's on a level and you miss
     it, it's gone forever. With preserve mode "on", if you miss an artifact, 
     it can turn up later provided you didn't pick it up and identify it 
     the first time (in which case there is no excuse for losing it.) But 
     you don't get the "special" feeling. (Chances are that a vault will 
     provide a good level feeling anyway, and quite possibly a couple of 
     good items which may or may not include an artifact.)

***** <birth_ironman>
Restrict the use of stairs/recall    [birth_ironman]
     This option, not recommended for non-advanced players, prevents the 
     generation of up staircases, and makes the scroll and effect of Word 
     of Recall not function: and teleport-level always goes down, as does 
     the spell of stair-creation, except on the quest levels of Sauron and 
     Morgoth.

***** <birth_no_stores>
Restrict the use of stores/home    [birth_no_stores]
     The stores are all closed. The home is someone else's, and locked. You 
     can keep nothing but what you carry with you, and get nothing but what 
     you find in the dungeon. No selling items, or buying potions of 
     restore stat... Not recommended for new players, or indeed for 
     sane players.

***** <birth_no_artifacts>
Restrict the creation of artifacts    [birth_no_artifacts]
     No artifacts will be created. Ever. Just *how* masochistic are you?

***** <birth_rand_artifacts>
Randomize some of the artifacts    [birth_rand_artifacts]
     A different set of artifacts will be created, in place of the standard 
     ones. This is intended primarily for people who have played enough to
     know what most of the standard artifacts do and have got bored with
     them.  Note that savefiles with random artifacts are not guaranteed
     to be compatible between different Angband versions!


=== Cheating options ===

***** <cheat_peek>
Peek into object creation    [cheat_peek]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at object creation.

***** <cheat_hear>
Peek into monster creation    [cheat_hear]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at monster creation.

***** <cheat_room>
Peek into dungeon creation    [cheat_room]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at room creation.

***** <cheat_xtra>
Peek into something else    [cheat_xtra]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can see debugging messages.

***** <cheat_know>
Know complete monster info    [cheat_know]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can know all about monsters.

***** <cheat_live>
Allow player to avoid death    [cheat_live]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can cheat death.


=== Window flags ===

Some platforms support "sub-windows", which are windows which can be used to
display useful information generally available through other means.  The best
thing about these windows is that they are updated automatically (usually) to
reflect the current state of the world.  The "window options" can be used to
specify what should be displayed in each window.  The possible choices should
be pretty obvious.

Display inven/equip
    Display the player inventory (and sometimes the equipment).

Display equip/inven
    Display the player equipment (and sometimes the inventory).

Display player flags
    Display a special description of the character, including some of the
    "flags" which pertain to a character, broken down by equipment item.

Display player screen
    Display a brief description of the character, including a breakdown
    of the current player "skills" (including attacks/shots per round).

=== Left Over Information ===

The "hitpoint_warn" value, if non-zero, is the percentage of maximal hitpoints
at which the player is warned that he may die.  It is also used as the cut-off
for using the color red to display both hitpoints and mana.

The "delay_factor" value, if non-zero, will slow down the visual effects used
for missile, bolt, beam, and ball attacks.  The actual time delay is equal to
"delay_factor" squared, in milliseconds.
