Roguelike Keyset Command Summary
================================

^ followed by a letter is an abbreviation for pressing and releasing
the letter key with the control key also depressed.  You may also press
and release ^ and then press and release the letter key to activate the
same command in case your system intercepts the control plus key
combination and does not pass it on.  The autoexplore_commands option
modifies the '<', '>', and 'p' commands.  When that option is off (that
is the default), the commands act as described below.  When that option
is on, '<' or '>' will use the staircase at the player's location if it
is the appropriate kind of staircase or will move to the nearest known
staircase of the appropriate kind if the player is not already at that
kind of staircase.  'p' will move to the nearest unexplored location
when the autoexplore_commands option is on.
