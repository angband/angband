Counts only work with somecommands, and will be terminated by the same things that end a rest or arun. In particular, typing any character during the execution of a countedcommand will terminate the command. Counted searches or tunnels will terminateon success, or if you are attacked.Control-R will redraw the screen whenever it is input, not only at commandlevel. A count with control-P will specify the number of previous messages.Control commands may be entered with a single key stroke, or with two keystrokes by typing ^ and then a letter.Type ESCAPE to abort the look command at any point.Some commands will prompt for a spell, or an inventory item. Selection isby an alphabetic character - entering a capital causes a desription to beprinted, and the selection may be aborted.Using repeat counts with the tunnel left command does not work well, becausetunnel left is the backspace character, and will delete the number you havejust typed in.  To avoid this, you can either enter ^H as two characters(^ and then H), or you can type ' ' (i.e. the space character) after thenumber at which point you will get a command prompt and backspace willwork correctly.
