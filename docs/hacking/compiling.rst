Compiling Instructions
======================

The methods for compiling Angband vary by platform and by build system. If
you get Angband working on a different platform or build system please let us
know so we can add to this file.

   :local:

macOS
-----

To build the new Cocoa front-end::

    cd src
    make -f Makefile.osx

Debug build
~~~~~~~~~~~

This will generate a debugging build like that described in the Linux section::

    cd src
    make -f Makefile.osx clean
    make -f Makefile.osx OPT="-g -O1 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize=address"

The clean step is there to clean out object files that were compiled with the
default options.  The "-g" adds debugging symbols.
"-O1 -fno-omit-frame-pointer" dials back the optimization to get call stack
traces that are easier to interpret.  For even clearer call stack traces, you
could add "-fno-optimize-sibling-calls" to the options or omit optimization
entirely by replacing "-O1 -fno-omit-frame-pointer" with "-O0".
"-fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined" enables the AddressSanitizer and
UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer tools.

To run the generated executable under Xcode's command-line debugger, lldb, do
this if you are already in the src directory from the compilation step::

    cd ../Angband.app/Contents/MacOS
    lldb ./angband

Linux / other UNIX
------------------

Native builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linux builds using autotools. There are several different front ends that you
can optionally build (GCU, SDL, X11, and GTK) using arguments to configure
such as --enable-sdl, --disable-gtk, etc. Each front end has different
dependencies (e.g. ncurses, SDL libraries, etc).

To build Angband to be run in-place::

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --with-no-install [other options as needed]
    make

To build Angband to be installed in some other location::

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix /path/to [other options as needed]
    make
    make install

On some BSDs, you may need to copy install-sh into lib/ and various
subdirectories of lib/ in order to install correctly.

Compilation with CMake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The compilation process with CMake requires a version greater than 3,
by default the compilation process uses the X11 front end unless
that the contrary is indicated. The optional front ends are: SDL and NCurses.

To build Angband (X11 Frontend) to be run::

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make

To build Angband with the frontend SDL::

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake  -DSUPPORT_SDL_FRONTEND=ON ..
    make

To build Angband with the frontend NCurses::

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake  -DSUPPORT_NCURSES_FRONTEND=ON ..
    make

Cross-building for Windows with Mingw
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many developers (as well as the auto-builder) build Angband for Windows using
Mingw on Linux. This requires that the necessary Mingw packages are all
installed.

This type of build now also uses autotools, so you must configure it to
cross-compile, e.g.::

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --enable-win --disable-curses --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=i586-mingw32msvc

Mingw installs commands like 'i586-mingw32msvc-gcc'. The value of --host
should be that same command with the '-gcc' removed. Instead of i586 you may
see i686, amd64, etc. The value of --build should be the host you're building
on. (See http://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/
autoconf-2.68/html_node/Specifying-Target-Triplets.html#Specifying%20Names for
gory details of how these triplets are arrived at)

TODO: you will probably need to manually disable curses, or the host curses
installation will be found, and will not be able to link properly. More
checking of permissible combinations to configure is necessary

Debug build
~~~~~~~~~~~

**WARNING** this build is intended primarily for debugging purposes. It might have a somewhat slower performance, higher memory requirements and panic saves don't always work (in case of a crash there is a higher chance of losing progress).

When debugging crashes it can be very useful to get more information about *what exactly* went wrong. There are many tools that can detect common issues and provide useful information. Two such tools that are best used together are AddressSanitizer (ASan) and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSan). To use them you'll need to enable them when compiling angband::

    ./configure [options]
    SANITIZE_FLAGS="-fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize=address" make

Note that compiling with this tools will require installing additional dependancies: libubsan libasan (names of the packages might be different in your distribution).

There is probably a way to get these tools to work on Windows. If you know how, please add the information to this file.

Windows
-------

Using MinGW
~~~~~~~~~~~

This build now also uses autotools, so should be very similar to the Linux
build. Open the MinGW shell (MSYS) by running msys.bat then run these commands::

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --enable-win
	make

The install target almost certainly won't work

Following build, to get the program to run, you need to copy the executable
from the src directory into the top-level dir, and copy 2 DLLs (libpng12.dll
and zlib1.dll) from src/win/dll to the top-level dir

Using Cygwin (with MinGW)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use this option if you want to build a native Windows executable that
can run with or without Cygwin.

Use the Cygwin setup.exe to install the mingw-gcc-core package and any
dependencies suggested by the installer.

Run these commands::

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --enable-win --with-no-install --host=i686-pc-mingw32
	make

As with the "Using MinGW" process, you need to copy the executable and
DLLs to the top-level dir.

If you want to build the Unix version of Angband that uses X11 or
Curses and run it under Cygwin, then follow the native build
instructions (./autogen.sh; ./configure; make; make install).

Using MSYS2 (with MinGW64) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the dependencies by::

	pacman -S make mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-ncurses

Additional dependencies for SDL2 client::

	pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_gfx \
		  mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_image mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_ttf

Then run the following to compile with ncurse::

	cd src
	make -f Makefile.msys2

For SDL2, do::

	cd src
	make -f Makefile.msys2.sdl2

Go to the root of the source directory and start angband by::

	./angband.exe -uPLAYER

The ncurse client may not be able to start properly from msys2 shell, try::

	start bash

and run::

	export TERM=
	./angband.exe -uPLAYER

Using eclipse (Indigo) on Windows (with MinGW)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* For eclipse with EGit, select File | Import..., Git | Projects from Git, Next >
* Clone your/the upstream repo, or Add your existing cloned repo, Next >
* Select "Use the New Projects Wizard", Finish
* In the New Project Wizard, select C/C++ | Makefile Project with Existing Code, Next >
* Give the project a name (Angband),
  * navigate to the repo you cloned in "Existing Code Location",
  * Select "C", but not "C++"
  * Choose "MinGW GCC" Toolchain, Finish
* Once the project is set up, r-click | Properties
* Go to C/C++ Build | Toolchain Editor, select "Gnu Make Builder" instead of "CDT Internal Builder"
* go to C/C++ Build, uncheck "Generate Makefiles automatically"

You still need to run ./autogen.sh and ./configure manually, outside eclipse (see above)

Using Visual Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
