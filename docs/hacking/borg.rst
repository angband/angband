Borg
====

The Borg is an "Automatic Angband Player".

It was first written for about 2.8.0, separate from the game as
distributed. It was pulled into the game in around 3.3. It was removed
in 4.0 as there was too much conflict with the big changes made then.
It was reincorporated in around 4.2.3.

The name comes from "The Borg" in Star Trek which, in turn, comes from
cyborg.

The primary use of the Borg is entertainment. It is fun to watch the
Borg play the game, and it can be amusing to see how it handles
situations. It has been used to test the game and find bugs.

Running The Borg
================

It is not recommended to run the Borg on a live game, as it could
cause unexpected behavior or even crashes. It is best to run the Borg
on its own save file, or on a copy of your save file.

To run the Borg:

1. Ensure Angband is compiled with borg support
2. Start or load a game
3. Press ``^z`` (Ctrl-Z) to access the Borg command interface
4. Press ``z`` to activate the Borg
5. Watch the Borg play automatically
6. Press any key to stop the Borg when desired

Borg Command Interface
======================

The Borg command interface is only available when Angband is compiled
with borg support.

To access the Borg command interface, press ``^z`` (Ctrl-Z) during
gameplay. When you first run the command you'll be presented with a warning
message you can continue through. The most common command is ``z`` which
starts the Borg.

Pressing any key while the Borg is running will stop the Borg.
