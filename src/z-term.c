/*
 * This file provides a generic, efficient, terminal window package,
 * which can be used not only on standard terminal environments such
 * as dumb terminals connected to a Unix box, but also in more modern
 * "graphic" environments, such as the Macintosh or Unix/X11.
 *
 * Each "window" works like a standard "dumb terminal", that is, it
 * can display a two dimensional array of grids containing colored
 * textual symbols, plus an optional cursor, and it can be used to
 * get keypress events from the user.
 *
 * In fact, this package can simply be used, if desired, to support
 * programs which will look the same on a dumb terminal as they do
 * on a graphic platform such as the Macintosh.
 *
 * This package was designed to help port the game "Angband" to a wide
 * variety of different platforms.  Angband, like many other games in
 * the "rogue-like" heirarchy, requires, at the minimum, the ability
 * to display "colored textual symbols" in a standard 80x24 "window",
 * such as that provided by most dumb terminals, and many old personal
 * computers, and to check for "keypresses" from the user.  The major
 * concerns were thus portability and efficiency, so Angband could be
 * easily ported to many different systems, with minimal effort, and
 * yet would run quickly on each of these systems, no matter what kind
 * of underlying hardware/software support was being used.
 *
 * It is important to understand the differences between the older
 * "dumb terminals" and the newer "graphic interface" machines, since
 * this package was designed to work with both types of systems.
 *
 * New machines:
 *   waiting for a keypress is complex
 *   checking for a keypress is often cheap
 *   changing "colors" may be expensive
 *   the "color" of a "blank" is rarely important
 *   moving the "cursor" is relatively cheap
 *   use a "software" cursor (only moves when requested)
 *   drawing characters normally will not erase old ones
 *   drawing a character on the cursor often erases it
 *   may have fast routines for "clear a region"
 *   the bottom right corner is usually not special
 *
 * Old machines:
 *   waiting for a keypress is simple
 *   checking for a keypress is often expensive
 *   changing "colors" is usually cheap
 *   the "color" of a "blank" may be important
 *   moving the "cursor" may be expensive
 *   use a "hardware" cursor (moves during screen updates)
 *   drawing new symbols automatically erases old ones
 *   characters may only be drawn at the cursor location
 *   drawing a character on the cursor will move the cursor
 *   may have fast routines for "clear entire window"
 *   may have fast routines for "clear to end of line"
 *   the bottom right corner is often dangerous
 *
 *
 * This package provides support for multiple windows, each of an
 * arbitrary size (up to 255x255), each with its own set of flags,
 * and its own hooks to handle several low-level procedures which
 * differ from platform to platform.  Then the main program simply
 * creates one or more "term" structures, setting the various flags
 * and hooks in a manner appropriate for the current platform, and
 * then it can use the various "term" structures without worrying
 * about the underlying platform.
 *
 *
 * This package allows each "grid" in each window to hold an attr/char
 * pair, with each ranging from 0 to 255, and makes very few assumptions
 * about the meaning of any attr/char values.  Normally, we assume that
 * "attr 0" is "black", with the semantics that "black" text should be
 * sent to "Term_wipe()" instead of "Term_text()", but this sematics is
 * modified if either the "always_pict" or the "always_text" flags are
 * set.  We assume that "char 0" is "dangerous", since placing such a
 * "char" in the middle of a string "terminates" the string, and usually
 * we prevent its use.
 *
 * Finally, we use a special attr/char pair, defaulting to "attr 0" and
 * "char 32", also known as "black space", when we "erase" or "clear"
 * any window, but this pair can be redefined to any pair, including
 * the standard "white space", or the bizarre "emptiness" ("attr 0"
 * and "char 0"), as long as various obscure restrictions are met.
 *
 *
 * This package provides several functions which allow a program to
 * interact with the "term" structures.  Most of the functions allow
 * the program to "request" certain changes to the current "term",
 * such as moving the cursor, drawing an attr/char pair, erasing a
 * region of grids, hiding the cursor, etc.  Then there is a special
 * function which causes all of the "pending" requests to be performed
 * in an efficient manner.  There is another set of functions which
 * allow the program to query the "requested state" of the current
 * "term", such as asking for the cursor location, or what attr/char
 * is at a given location, etc.  There is another set of functions
 * dealing with "keypress" events, which allows the program to ask if
 * the user has pressed any keys, or to forget any keys the user pressed.
 * There is a pair of functions to allow this package to memorize the
 * contents of the current "term", and to restore these contents at
 * a later time.  There is a special function which allows the program
 * to specify which "term" structure should be the "current" one.  At
 * the lowest level, there is a set of functions which allow a new
 * "term" to be initialized or destroyed, and which allow this package,
 * or a program, to access the special "hooks" defined for the current
 * "term", and a set of functions which those "hooks" can use to inform
 * this package of the results of certain occurances, for example, one
 * such function allows this package to learn about user keypresses,
 * detected by one of the special "hooks".
 *
 * We provide, among other things, the functions "Term_keypress()"
 * to "react" to keypress events, and "Term_redraw()" to redraw the
 * entire window, plus "Term_resize()" to note a new size.
 *
 *
 * Note that the current "term" contains two "window images".  One of
 * these images represents the "requested" contents of the "term", and
 * the other represents the "actual" contents of the "term", at the time
 * of the last performance of pending requests.  This package uses these
 * two images to determine the "minimal" amount of work needed to make
 * the "actual" contents of the "term" match the "requested" contents of
 * the "term".  This method is not perfect, but it often reduces the
 * amount of work needed to perform the pending requests, which thus
 * increases the speed of the program itself.  This package promises
 * that the requested changes will appear to occur either "all at once"
 * or in a "top to bottom" order.  In addition, a "cursor" is maintained,
 * and this cursor is updated along with the actual window contents.
 *
 * Currently, the "Term_fresh()" routine attempts to perform the "minimum"
 * number of physical updates, in terms of total "work" done by the hooks
 * Term_wipe(), Term_text(), and Term_pict(), making use of the fact that
 * adjacent characters of the same color can both be drawn together using
 * the "Term_text()" hook, and that "black" text can often be sent to the
 * "Term_wipe()" hook instead of the "Term_text()" hook, and if something
 * is already displayed in a window, then it is not necessary to display
 * it again.  Unfortunately, this may induce slightly non-optimal results
 * in some cases, in particular, those in which, say, a string of ten
 * characters needs to be written, but the fifth character has already
 * been displayed.  Currently, this will cause the "Term_text()" routine
 * to be called once for each half of the string, instead of once for the
 * whole string, which, on some machines, may be non-optimal behavior.
 *
 * The new formalism includes a "displayed" screen image (old) which
 * is actually seen by the user, a "requested" screen image (scr)
 * which is being prepared for display, a "memorized" screen image
 * (mem) which is used to save and restore screen images, and a
 * "temporary" screen image (tmp) which is currently unused.
 *
 *
 * Several "flags" are available in each "term" to allow the underlying
 * visual system (which initializes the "term" structure) to "optimize"
 * the performance of this package for the given system, or to request
 * certain behavior which is helpful/required for the given system.
 *
 * The "soft_cursor" flag indicates the use of a "soft" cursor, which
 * only moves when explicitly requested,and which is "erased" when
 * any characters are drawn on top of it.  This flag is used for all
 * "graphic" systems which handle the cursor by "drawing" it.
 *
 * The "icky_corner" flag indicates that the bottom right "corner"
 * of the windows are "icky", and "printing" anything there may
 * induce "messy" behavior, such as "scrolling".  This flag is used
 * for most old "dumb terminal" systems.
 *
 *
 * The "term" structure contains the following function "hooks":
 *
 *   Term->init_hook = Init the term
 *   Term->nuke_hook = Nuke the term
 *   Term->xtra_hook = Perform extra actions
 *   Term->curs_hook = Draw (or Move) the cursor
 *   Term->bigcurs_hook = Draw (or Move) the big cursor (bigtile mode)
 *   Term->wipe_hook = Draw some blank spaces
 *   Term->text_hook = Draw some text in the window
 *   Term->pict_hook = Draw some attr/chars in the window
 *
 * The "Term->xtra_hook" hook provides a variety of different functions,
 * based on the first parameter (which should be taken from the various
 * TERM_XTRA_* defines) and the second parameter (which may make sense
 * only for some first parameters).  It is available to the program via
 * the "Term_xtra()" function, though some first parameters are only
 * "legal" when called from inside this package.
 *
 * The "Term->curs_hook" hook provides this package with a simple way
 * to "move" or "draw" the cursor to the grid "x,y", depending on the
 * setting of the "soft_cursor" flag.  Note that the cursor is never
 * redrawn if "nothing" has happened to the screen (even temporarily).
 * This hook is required.
 *
 * The "Term->wipe_hook" hook provides this package with a simple way
 * to "erase", starting at "x,y", the next "n" grids.  This hook assumes
 * that the input is valid.  This hook is required, unless the setting
 * of the "always_pict" or "always_text" flags makes it optional.
 *
 * The "Term->text_hook" hook provides this package with a simple way
 * to "draw", starting at "x,y", the "n" chars contained in "cp", using
 * the attr "a".  This hook assumes that the input is valid, and that
 * "n" is between 1 and 256 inclusive, but it should NOT assume that
 * the contents of "cp" are null-terminated.  This hook is required,
 * unless the setting of the "always_pict" flag makes it optional.
 *
 * The "Term->pict_hook" hook provides this package with a simple way
 * to "draw", starting at "x,y", the "n" attr/char pairs contained in
 * the arrays "ap" and "cp".  This hook assumes that the input is valid,
 * and that "n" is between 1 and 256 inclusive, but it should NOT assume
 * that the contents of "cp" are null-terminated.  This hook is optional,
 * unless the setting of the "always_pict" or "higher_pict" flags make
 * it required.  Note that recently, this hook was changed from taking
 * a byte "a" and a char "c" to taking a length "n", an array of bytes
 * "ap" and an array of chars "cp".  Old implementations of this hook
 * should now iterate over all "n" attr/char pairs.
 * The two new arrays "tap" and "tcp" can contain the attr/char pairs
 * of the terrain below the values in "ap" and "cp".  These values can
 * be used to implement transparency when using graphics by drawing
 * the terrain values as a background and the "ap", "cp" values in
 * the foreground.
 *
 * The game "Angband" uses a set of files called "main-xxx.c", for
 * various "xxx" suffixes.  Most of these contain a function called
 * "init_xxx()", that will prepare the underlying visual system for
 * use with Angband, and then create one or more "term" structures,
 * using flags and hooks appropriate to the given platform, so that
 * the "main()" function can call one (or more) of the "init_xxx()"
 * functions, as appropriate, to prepare the required "term" structs
 * (one for each desired sub-window), and these "init_xxx()" functions
 * are called from a centralized "main()" function in "main.c".  Other
 * "main-xxx.c" systems contain their own "main()" function which, in
 * addition to doing everything needed to initialize the actual program,
 * also does everything that the normal "init_xxx()" functions would do.
 *
 * The game "Angband" defines, in addition to "attr 0", all of the
 * attr codes from 1 to 15, using definitions in "defines.h", and
 * thus the "main-xxx.c" files used by Angband must handle these
 * attr values correctly.  Also, they must handle all other attr
 * values, though they may do so in any way they wish, for example,
 * by always taking every attr code mod 16.  Many of the "main-xxx.c"
 * files use "white space" ("attr 1" / "char 32") to "erase" or "clear"
 * any window, for efficiency.
 *
 * See "main-xxx.c" for a simple skeleton file which can be used to
 * create a "visual system" for a new platform when porting Angband.

/*
 * Actually perform all requested changes to the window
 *
 * If absolutely nothing has changed, not even temporarily, or if the
 * current "Term" is not mapped, then this function will return 1 and
 * do absolutely nothing.
 *
 * Note that when "soft_cursor" is true, we erase the cursor (if needed)
 * whenever anything has changed, and redraw it (if needed) after all of
 * the screen updates are complete.  This will induce a small amount of
 * "cursor flicker" but only when the screen has been updated.  If the
 * screen is updated and then restored, you may still get this flicker.
 *
 * When "soft_cursor" is not true, we make the cursor invisible before
 * doing anything else if it is supposed to be invisible by the time we
 * are done, and we make it visible after moving it to its final location
 * after all of the screen updates are complete.
 *
 * Note that "Term_xtra(TERM_XTRA_CLEAR,0)" must erase the entire screen,
 * including the cursor, if needed, and may place the cursor anywhere.
 *
 * Note that "Term_xtra(TERM_XTRA_FROSH,y)" will be always be called
 * after any row "y" has been "flushed", unless the "Term->never_frosh"
 * flag is set, and "Term_xtra(TERM_XTRA_FRESH,0)" will be called after
 * all of the rows have been "flushed".
 *
 * Note the use of three different functions to handle the actual flush,
 * based on the settings of the "Term->always_pict" and "Term->higher_pict"
 * flags (see below).
 *
 * The three helper functions (above) work by collecting similar adjacent
 * grids into stripes, and then sending each stripe to "Term->pict_hook",
 * "Term->text_hook", or "Term->wipe_hook", based on the settings of the
 * "Term->always_pict" and "Term->higher_pict" flags, which select which
 * of the helper functions to call to flush each row.
 *
 * The helper functions currently "skip" any grids which already contain
 * the desired contents.  This may or may not be the best method, especially
 * when the desired content fits nicely into the current stripe.  For example,
 * it might be better to go ahead and queue them while allowed, but keep a
 * count of the "trailing skipables", then, when time to flush, or when a
 * "non skippable" is found, force a flush if there are too many skippables.
 *
 * Perhaps an "initialization" stage, where the "text" (and "attr")
 * buffers are "filled" with information, converting "blanks" into
 * a convenient representation, and marking "skips" with "zero chars",
 * and then some "processing" is done to determine which chars to skip.
 *
 * Currently, the helper functions are optimal for systems which prefer
 * to "print a char + move a char + print a char" to "print three chars",
 * and for applications that do a lot of "detailed" color printing.
 *
 * In the two "queue" functions, total "non-changes" are "pre-skipped".
 * The helper functions must also handle situations in which the contents
 * of a grid are changed, but then changed back to the original value,
 * and situations in which two grids in the same row are changed, but
 * the grids between them are unchanged.
 *
 * If the "Term->always_pict" flag is set, then "Term_fresh_row_pict()"
 * will be used instead of "Term_fresh_row_text()".  This allows all the
 * modified grids to be collected into stripes of attr/char pairs, which
 * are then sent to the "Term->pict_hook" hook, which can draw these pairs
 * in whatever way it would like.
 *
 * If the "Term->higher_pict" flag is set, then "Term_fresh_row_both()"
 * will be used instead of "Term_fresh_row_text()".  This allows all the
 * "special" attr/char pairs (in which both the attr and char have the
 * high-bit set) to be sent (one pair at a time) to the "Term->pict_hook"
 * hook, which can draw these pairs in whatever way it would like.
 *
 * Normally, the "Term_wipe()" function is used only to display "blanks"
 * that were induced by "Term_clear()" or "Term_erase()", and then only
 * if the "attr_blank" and "char_blank" fields have not been redefined
 * to use "white space" instead of the default "black space".  Actually,
 * the "Term_wipe()" function is used to display all "black" text, such
 * as the default "spaces" created by "Term_clear()" and "Term_erase()".
 *
 * Note that the "Term->always_text" flag will disable the use of the
 * "Term_wipe()" function hook entirely, and force all text, even text
 * drawn in the color "black", to be explicitly drawn.  This is useful
 * for machines which implement "Term_wipe()" by just drawing spaces.
 *
 * Note that the "Term->always_pict" flag will disable the use of the
 * "Term_wipe()" function entirely, and force everything, even text
 * drawn in the attr "black", to be explicitly drawn.
 *
 * Note that if no "black" text is ever drawn, and if "attr_blank" is
 * not "zero", then the "Term_wipe" hook will never be used, even if
 * the "Term->always_text" flag is not set.
 *
 * This function does nothing unless the "Term" is "mapped", which allows
 * certain systems to optimize the handling of "closed" windows.
 *
 * On systems with a "soft" cursor, we must explicitly erase the cursor
 * before flushing the output, if needed, to prevent a "jumpy" refresh.
 * The actual method for this is horrible, but there is very little that
 * we can do to simplify it efficiently.  XXX XXX XXX
 *
 * On systems with a "hard" cursor, we will "hide" the cursor before
 * flushing the output, if needed, to avoid a "flickery" refresh.  It
 * would be nice to *always* hide the cursor during the refresh, but
 * this might be expensive (and/or ugly) on some machines.
 *
 * The "Term->icky_corner" flag is used to avoid calling "Term_wipe()"
 * or "Term_pict()" or "Term_text()" on the bottom right corner of the
 * window, which might induce "scrolling" or other nasty stuff on old
 * dumb terminals.  This flag is handled very efficiently.  We assume
 * that the "Term_curs()" call will prevent placing the cursor in the
 * corner, if needed, though I doubt such placement is ever a problem.
 * Currently, the use of "Term->icky_corner" and "Term->soft_cursor"
 * together may result in undefined behavior.
