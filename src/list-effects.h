 * "rating" is the power rating for an item activation, as a damage-per-blow
 * equivalent (x2). These ratings are used in the calculation of the power (and
 * therefore cost) of an item which has the effect as an activation, but NOT
 * for other items (e.g. potions, scrolls). Hence the use of INIHIBIT_POWER.
