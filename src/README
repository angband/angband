Overview--------The game of Angband is a single player dungeon simulation.  A player maychoose from a number of races and classes when creating a character, andthen `run' that character over a period of days, weeks, even months,attempting to win the game by defeating Morgoth who lurks in the deeperlevels.Angband was originally based on UMoria, with new monsters including uniquesfrom J.R.R. Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" and "The Silmarillion", specialartifacts, many new rooms, and an assortment of other cool features.  Youwill probably enjoy the game a lot more if you have read Tolkien's books.Players should at least look over the file angband.man.txt first, since itwill answer many questions.  Also, there is a "frequently-asked questions"document available (called angband.faq) which provides additional informationabout the game, including directions to the primary FTP site for Angband andderivatives.  Both of these files are contained in the lib_2.6.2.tar.gzarchive under the directory LIBDIR/files.General-------Angband 2.6.x has been reported to work on the following systems:SunOS/Solaris, Ultrix, OSF/1, HP/UX, NEXTSTEP, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, IRIX,OS/2, Mac, Atari, Amiga.MS-DOS users should probably get PC Angband 1.40 (or later), as that versionsupports color and is specifically tuned for that environment.  If you do nothave one of the above systems, it is likely that Angband will not compilecorrectly without some level of modification to the source code-- consult the"Porting Considerations" section below.To get Angband running, you must first get the source code and library files,and extract them from the gzip'ed gnutar'ed archives (denoted by the".tar.gz" suffix).  Gunzip and gnutar are available via anonymous FTP fromprep.ai.mit.edu as /pub/gnu/gzip-1.2.4.tar and /pub/gnu/tar-1.11.2.tar.gz.After extracting the files, edit config.h and the Makefile as directed.Note that you must set LIBDIR or DEFAULT_PATH (in config.h) to point towherever the library files (and the savefile directory) are going to beplaced.  Make sure that you specify a complete and fully qualified pathname(ie, one that starts with a "/").  DO NOT use ".", "..", or "~", as thesewill not work reliably on many systems.Installation------------Angband can be played by many people at once, and it is normally installedsetuid so that only the game can read and modify saved games and thescorefile.  Angband can be configured to use special routines under AFS(the Andrew File System) for authentication to provide the samefunctionality as normal setuid execution.Ideally, your system should have a special "games" account which will ownthe Angband files and executable.  You may wish to consult an experiencedUnix person or system administrator if you are not familiar with setuidexecutables, the typical installation of this class of games, or how tocreate a games account.Angband should probably not be installed setuid root, because doing so is apossible security risk, but there aren't any security holes that I know of.Whomever installs the game (perhaps yourself since you're reading thisdocument) should edit the files in LIBDIR/files, especially the news file.Please update these to describe the installation, such as telling playerswhere to find the manual and the FAQ.  You should also add your name andemail address so that players can direct questions to you first (not me).Savefiles---------Player savefiles are stored in LIBDIR/save.  The default filename chosenconsists of the player's UserID and UserName appended together, as in"0Root" for a game played by the superuser on normal Unix systems.  Gamesbeing played are moved to a new name with a prefix of "p.", as in "p.0Root".Recent versions of Angband now support multiple games per player via the"-uCharacterName" command line option to the game.Support and Getting Help------------------------I have made Angband freely available to the public in the hope that peopleenjoy the game.  I estimate that I have spent upwards of 750 hours overthe past year and a half coding the game, playtesting, and reading andanswering email.Because I receive no recompense for working on Angband, I simply cannotpromise that I can get the game working for you, answer your questions, oranything else-- although I will try.  Also, please understand that I havereal work and a life to deal with, and thus my response time may be slow.(I apologize in advance for a possibly brusque response; no discourtesy isintended, but my time is limited.)Please first try to talk to someone local at your site, such as a games orsystem administrator.  You might also try looking through the FAQ and/orposting a message to the Internet newsgroup rec.games.roguelike.angband, ifyou have access to netnews.If the above doesn't help, you can email me at "cs4w+@andrew.cmu.edu".If you are having problems compiling the game, please build as much of thegame as possible via "make -k", and then run a second "make -k" and appendthe output of this to your message.  This will make it easier and fasterfor me to help you, and it will consume less of my time, leaving me with moretime to work on the game itself.Porting Considerations----------------------If Angband does not work on your system, and you have the time and theability to port the game, it would be nice for you to make your workavailable to everyone, thereby making it easier for other people to playAngband.  Please note that I cannot write code for systems which I don'thave access to!The most productive way for doing a port is to determine a unique compilerdefine for your system, and then use it when producing your modificationswith "#ifdef FLAG" statements, so that your changes don't effect othersystems.  Ideas for what this flag can be determined by examining the outputof "gcc -v create.c", as the following demonstrates:% gcc -v create.cReading specs from /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/m68k-next-nextstep3/2.6.2/specsgcc version 2.6.2 /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/m68k-next-nextstep3/2.6.2/cpp -lang-c -v -undef-D__GNUC__=2 -D__GNUC_MINOR__=6 -Dmc68000 -Dm68k -DNeXT -Dunix -D__MACH__-D__BIG_ENDIAN__  -D__ARCHITECTURE__="m68k" -D__mc68000__ -D__m68k__-D__NeXT__ -D__unix__ -D__MACH__ -D__BIG_ENDIAN__ -D__ARCHITECTURE__="m68k"-D__mc68000 -D__m68k -D__NeXT -D__unix -Asystem(unix) -Asystem(mach)-Acpu(m68k) -Amachine(m68k) -D__STDC__ -D_NEXT_SOURCE create.c/usr/tmp/cc003300.iThe logical flag to use for my machine would be "NeXT".(People without gcc may have to consult their compiler's manpages anddocumentation to determine which flags are predefined on their system.)Then use the diff program to generate differences between the originalunmodified source code (you did keep it around, right?) and yours andsend these diff's to me at the email address below.  Please use"diff -c -w" when making diffs; this means to make context diffs and toignore any differences in whitespace.  Please remember to edit your diffson order to remove any site-specific changes (such as where LIBDIR goes).GNU diff is available from prep.ai.mit.edu in /pub/gnu/diffutils-2.7.tar.gz.Credits and Legalese--------------------Please read the LIBDIR/files/version.hlp document for credits about theprogrammers who have spent their time writing Moria, UMoria, and previousversions of Angband.  Also, please read the top of main.c and angband.h forthe copyright message and legal obligations for using the game.  Remember togive credit to me and the other programmers should you use parts of theAngband source code for your own (non-commercial) purposes.BSD Random code---------------I have included the BSD random() library because it offers a much better random number generator than what was previously used in rnd.c.  If yoursystem complains about "random" being undefined at link time, then youshould compile random.c and add it to your system's libc (or add it to thelink via the Makefile).  Note that this is unlikely to be a problem on anybut the most antiquated SysV unix system, but will happen on PC's.Please read the top of random.c for copyright and usage information.Angband uses software which "was developed by the University of California,Berkeley".                    Thanks, and enjoy the game.                           -Chuck Swiger
