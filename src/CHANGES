Here's a complete change log from 5.2.1 to the release of 5.5:

---------- 5/31
all: released umoria 5.2.1
ibmpc/ms_misc.c: corrected warn() function to use va_list, the old function
	was not strictly correct
---------- 6/4
misc2.c: prt_stat_block() must also call prt_study()
misc2.c: random_object() could create objects outside of map boudaries,
	added an in_bounds() call to fix
------------- 6/6
main.c: changed 'if (p = getenv(...))' to 'if ((p = getenv(...)) != NULL)'
	to avoid compiler warnings
moria1.c: rest_on(), add check to make sure rest_num fits in short
ibmpc/umoria.prj: new file, a project file for Turbo C 2.0
------------- 6/9
io.c: HP-UX does not have VEOL2, added #ifdef VEOL2 around its use
dungeon.c: clear message line after change_character(), since as ESCAPE
	exit does not
moria1.c: for 'x' and 'w' commands, clear heavy_weapon flag before calling
	check_strength, so that always get heavy message when wielding heavy
	weapon, and never get light message when wielding light weapon
scrolls.c: identify scroll can move arbitrarily far after ident_spell(),
	replace simple 'moved one down' check with loop to search until found
main.c: fixed starup code so that don't get 'savefile doesn't exist'
	message anymore when starting a new game
all: apply fix to all uses of long constant with & | << operators to avoid
	a Mark Williams C bug on the Atari ST
externs.h, files.c: removed MSDOS declaration of errno from files.c, and
	remove ifndef MSDOS from errno decl in externs.h
misc1.c: changed name of variable 'clock' to 'clock_var' to avoid problem
	with a mac compiler (not sure which one)
io.c: every io.c file, remove '\0' as alias for ESCAPE from get_com() and
	get_comdir() (MAC only function)
moria1.c: light_dam() calls inven_damage(set_lightning_destroy, 3) which
	gives it a small chance of destroying objects in player's pack,
	this makes it just like the other *_dam() functions
spells.c: teleport_to(), add call to in_bound() to make sure player will
	be teleported to somewhere inside the dungeon
------------- 6/10
config.h: add note about using GCC on an Atari ST
main.c, save.c, undef.c: eliminated the unused _new_log() function
death.c, dungeon.c, externs.h, save.c, undef.c, variable.c: eliminated the
	mostly unused log_index variable, the few uses of it were replaced
	with references to character_saved
externs.h, files.c, io.c, undef.c: init_scorefile() implemented, same as
	in umoria 4.87
main.c, undef.c: eliminate unused function init_files()

----------- 6/11
ibmpc/ms_misc.c: added space to GRAPHICS scanf, to try to eliminate problem
	with Turco C
death.c, externs.h, files.c, save.c, variable.c: extensive changes to
	implement the scorefile, total_points(), highscores(), display_
	scores(), set_fileptr(), rd_highscore(), and wr_highscore() defined
	scorefile holds 1000 entries max, has one sex/race/class entry per
	non-zero uid, has live characters also
unix/Makefile: fix the treatment of score file, don't copy over old one,
	just use touch to create one if it doesn't exist
undef.c: finally eliminated
---------- 6/13
all: lint under 4.3 BSD and AIX 2.2.1 (SYS V)
scores: readd scores file, since it makes micro distributions much easier
death.c: modify savefile for single user machine, so that it tries to
	prevent a single character from appearing multiple times in the
	savefile, checks for identical names, and killed by = (saved)
player.c: eliminated the unused dsp_race[] array
death.c: added code to implement flock() for systems which don't have it,
	based on code written by CJS for BRUCE Moria
---------- 6/17
all: fixes for VMS, define USG for VMS, merge in fixes from Todd Pierzina
---------- 6/23
scrolls.c: for curse weapon, call py_bonuses(-1) before clear flags so
	that attributes will be turned off
moria1.c: calc_bonuses(), handle AC just like everything else, previously
	did not add in AC bonus if armor was cursed
creature.c, moria2.c: doors weren't being broken when bashed, change
	"randint(2) - 1" to "1 - randint(2)"
----------- 7/14
all: merge in some changes indiciated by warnings/prototypes generated by
	MSC 5.x

death.c, dungeon.c: fixed display_scores() and 'V' command problems
creature.c, dungeon.c, misc2.c, moria1.c: new feature '*' rest until
	reach max mana and hp, print error message for illegal rest count
all: removed improper define of NULL, new define CNIL for (char *)0, used
	instead of NULL where appropriate, eliminate strange include orders
	that the previous NULL define required
io.c: ifdefed out the include for termio.h, as this caused it to be included
	twice on some systems (curses.h includes it also) causing problems
macrsrc.h: changed MAX_RESTART from 37 to 36
--------- 7/21
ms_misc.c: fixed reading of empty lines from config file for Turbo C
-------- 7/22
io.c: fix Amiga code for flush()
types.h: reduce size of cave_type structure for Amiga/Aztec C 5.0
death.c: fix display_scores(), so that it only shows entries belonging to
	current player when show_player is true
--------- 8/29
misc2.c: deleted some redundant code in gain_spells() where it calculates
	which spells a player can learn
spells.c: recharge(), could call randint() with 0 or negative numbers, check
	for these cases before calling randint()
--------- 9/8
moria1.c: inven_command(), when drop/remove object and inven/equip are both
	empty, set inven weight to zero, just to be safe
dungeon.c: jamdoor(), when jam a door, decrement inven_weight by weight of
	one spike
moria1.c: inven_command(), make spikes wieldable objects, fight with them
	like missile weapons, i.e. they disappear after use
desc.c: objdes(), add damage multiplier of bows to their name
externs.h, io.c, misc1.c, save.c variable.c: new option sound_beep_flag, so
	that players can turn off bad character beep if desired
desc.c, misc2.c: modify known1_p() to return TRUE for objects which never
	have a color, modify objdes() to work with the new convention,
	modify inven_carry() so that objects are added to the inventory
	sorted by subval if they are known1_p()
---------- 9/9
misc1.c: add_food(), fix so that does not use f_ptr->slow to set f_ptr->food
	value, this makes it much less likely to overflow the food level
misc2.c: inven_carry(), yesterday's insert in order fix does not work for
	items which can be unknown1p, only insert items ordered by subval if
	they are always known1p, i.e. object_offset() returns -1
externs.h, misc1.c, misc2.c, save.c variable.c: new option display rest/repeat
	counts, since these counts make resting at 1200 baud or less
	unbearably slow, people need to be able to turn them off
store2.c: get_haggle(), let RET default to the last inc/dec amount when
	haggling
misc1.c: compact_monsters(), return FALSE if could not delete any monsters
	instead of aborting, popm() return -1 if could not allocate monster
	(i.e. compact_monsters() failed), place_win_monster() abort if popm()
	fails which should never happen, place_monster()
externs.h: place_monster() now int type not void,
creature.c, misc1.c, spells.c: fix users of place_monster() to check result,
	and fail if place_monster() failed, really only necessary for the
	calls in creature.c, these fixes fix the monster list overflow bug
dungeon.c, externs.h, misc1.c: change compact_monsters() from static to
	extern, call it from within main loop in dungeon.c if there are less
	than 10 spaces left in the monster list, compact_monsters() is much
	more likely to be successful when called here than when called from
	creatures()
----------- 9/11
signals.c: delete extra definition of error_sig for ATARIST_MWC
atari_st/README: update with GCC and Turbo C info
files.c: fix typo, filname1 -> filename1
--------------- 9/18

------------- 9/19
misc1.c: m_bonus(), could overflow on 16 bit machines when level >= 263
	when calculating stand_dev
death.c, externs.h, save.c: store the encryption byte for each savefile record
	immediately before it in the scorefile, makes the scorefile more
	robust in the face of a system crash, rd_highscore(), wr_highscore()
	no longer pass the encryption byte
death.c: added version numbers to the savefile
death.c, externs.h, save.c, variable.c: add max_score to savefile, which is
	the maximum score the character has reached so far, total_points()
	modified to use the larger of the computed score, and the value of
	max_score, this prevents a "(saved)" message on the score file for
	a dead character, which died having fewer points than when it was
	last saved
----------- 9/26
death.c, externs.h, main.c, save.c, types.h, variable.c: new global variable
	birth_date, set to time when character created, saved in save files
	and scorefile, when loading character check to see if the a character
	in the scorefile has the same race/sex/class/uid/birth_date and
	its died_from is not "(saved)", in which case this character will not
	be scored
misc2.c: print "Duplicate" on screen for such duplicate characters
all: update all documentation, README, and other misc descriptive files
all: add fixes for Atari ST/Turbo C 2.0
all: lint on Sun3/uVAX/MIPS/RT_PC

all: fix all problems reported by maniscan/cshar, except for control-L
	characters on a line by themselves
----------- 10/7
creature.c: mon_move(), cast m_ptr->fy-1 to int, so that negative values
	will correctly compare to it, in the wall building code
spoilers: new file, lists spell damages
misc2.c: prt_experience(), always check whether exp is greater than max_exp,
	previously did not when player was at level 40

	should have moved but did not, instead of the old method of setting it
	when a non-moving monster attacked
store2.c: get_haggle(), fix bugs in the automatic increment code, also, when
	reach final offer, set the automatic increment to the required diff,
	so that player need only hit return to bid the final amount
moria2.c: tunnel(), before checking for tunneling into a invisible monster,
	check to make sure player is tunneling somewhere which has an effect,
	otherwise, player can use this to 'detect' invisible monsters in
	open spaces by trying to tunnel there
moria1.c: calc_bonuses(), base AC should always be visible, as long as the
	item is not cursed
------- 10/8

	stdin has been detected
all: released 5.2.2 sources

	read/write mode, previously only did this for VMS, now do this for
	all systems

death.c: MSDOS setmode() needs file descriptor, not FILE pointer
files/*: removed all TABS, since some systems do not handle them properly,
	specifically, Turbo C on the Atari ST and IBM-PC

::::::: 1992 ::::::::
Maintenance taken over by David Grabiner
--------- 7/16
moria4.c: bash(), use random direction if player is confused
spells.c: fire_ball(), fire_bolt(), don't update recall if monster not lit;
	this can happen if bolt hits an invisible monster
spells.c: speed_monsters(), sleep_monsters2(), dispel_creature(), 
	turn_undead(), only affect creatures within MAX_SIGHT 
spells.c: mass_poly(), area of effect should be <= MAX_SIGHT, was <
spells.c: destroy_area(), remove light from player's spot
spells.c: enchant(), add new variable limit, chance of failure is now
	(plusses/limit), with very slight chance of success over limit
scrolls.c: when enchanting melee weapons to damage, set limit to weapon's
	maximum damage, otherwise use 10 to give behavior similar to old method
misc2.c: magic_treasure(), make standard deviation of damage bonus on a melee 
	weapon proportional to weapon's maximum damage; these changes mean
	that daggers can no longer become powerful weapons
treasure.c: the Zweihander has now become a great weapon, value increased from
	1000 to 1500
externs.h: fix declaration for enchant()
staffs.c, wands.c: give everyone a slight chance to use difficult wands and
	staffs, otherwise a warrior will never be able to use many items
--------- 7/23
death.c: print_tomb(), insert msg_print(CNIL) so that "You are using:" and
	"You are carrying:" don't get combined as one message; this made it
	impossible to see the equipment list
store2.c: haggle_insults(), insert msg_print(CNIL) so that insult is always
	recognizable
store2.c: purchase_haggle() and sell_haggle(), new variable didnt_haggle,
	don't call updatebargain if no haggle
store1.c: noneedtobargain(), changed to sliding scale, (good-3*bad) must
	be more than 5 + (price/50) to skip haggling, so that haggling for
	cheap items is over quickly, but can still eventually skip
	haggle for all items
store1.c: updatebargain(), now update for all items worth >9 gold, instead
	of just 10-999, since it is now possible to skip haggling for more
	valuable items as well
--------- 7/25
moria4.c: bash(), unsuccessful bash takes a turn; otherwise, you can
	attempt to bash in different directions while confused or to locate
	invisible monsters; eliminate variable no_bash
--------- 7/27
check all above changes
moria4.c: bash(), get "You bash at empty space" method when bashing a
	wall, corrected to "nothing interesting	happens"; this also
	prevents bashing from locating a secret door
--------- 8/9
merge in all changes from 5.4.0 to 5.4.1
creature.c: update attack information only if monster is visible; update
	death information even if monster is not visible, since
	information will be on tombstone
*: change version number to 5.5.0
--------- 8/12
spells.c: enchant(), guard against randint(0) if called with limit of 0
	(it shouldn't be).
moria4.c: throw_object(), py_bash(), don't do negative damage
shortnam.sed, spells.c: fire_ball(), fix spelling of "envelops"
doc/faq: remove old spoilers file, and put current FAQ here instead
*: put my name (DJG) in credits as contact
*: change copyright date in all source files to 1992
---------- 8/13

---------- 10/31
misc4.c: scribe_object() allowed inscriptions longer than 12 characters
	if 13-24 characters availble for inscription, could overwrite
	other data
