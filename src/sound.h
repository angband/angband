/*
 * Structure to held data relating to a sound.
 *  name :      Base name of the sound (no path or file extension)
 *
 *  hash :      Used to speed up searches
 *
 *  loaded :    The platform's sound module sets this flag if it has enough
 *              information to play the sound (this may mean the sound data
 *              is loaded into memory, or that the full filename has been
 *              stored in the platform data. It is up to the platform's
 *              sound module to determine what 'loaded' means. The core
 *              sound module uses this flag to check if the sound needs to
 *              be 'loaded' before attempting to play it.

 *  plat_data : Platform specific structure used to store any additional
 *              data the platform's sound module needs in order to play the
 *              sound (and release resources when shut down)
