 * Accept values for y and x (considered as the endpoints of lines) between

 *
 * This table's input and output need some processing:
 *
 * Because this table gives degrees for a whole circle, up to radius 20, its
 * origin is at (x,y) = (20, 20).  Therefore, the input code needs to find
 * the origin grid (where the lines being compared come from), and then map
 * it to table grid 20,20.  Do not, however, actually try to compare the
 * angle of a line that begins and ends at the origin with any other line -
 * it is impossible mathematically, and the table will return the value "255".
 *
 * The output of this table also needs to be massaged, in order to avoid the
 * discontinuity at 0/180 degrees.  This can be done by:
 *   rotate = 90 - first value
 *   this rotates the first input to the 90 degree line)
 *   tmp = ABS(second value + rotate) % 180
 *   diff = ABS(90 - tmp) = the angular difference (divided by two) between
 *   the first and second values.
 *
 * Note that grids diagonal to the origin have unique angles.

/****** Running code ******/

/*
 * Basically, once you start running, you keep moving until something
 * interesting happens.  In an enclosed space, you run straight, but
 * you follow corners as needed (i.e. hallways).  In an open space,
 * you run straight, but you stop before entering an enclosed space
 * (i.e. a room with a doorway).  In a semi-open space (with walls on
 * one side only), you run straight, but you stop before entering an
 * enclosed space or an open space (i.e. running along side a wall).
 *
 * All discussions below refer to what the player can see, that is,
 * an unknown wall is just like a normal floor.  This means that we
 * must be careful when dealing with "illegal" grids.
 *
 * No assumptions are made about the layout of the dungeon, so this
 * algorithm works in hallways, rooms, town, destroyed areas, etc.
 *
 * In the diagrams below, the player has just arrived in the grid
 * marked as '@', and he has just come from a grid marked as 'o',
 * and he is about to enter the grid marked as 'x'.
 *
 * Running while confused is not allowed, and so running into a wall
 * is only possible when the wall is not seen by the player.  This
 * will take a turn and stop the running.
 *
 * Several conditions are tracked by the running variables.
 *
 *   p_ptr->run_open_area (in the open on at least one side)
 *   p_ptr->run_break_left (wall on the left, stop if it opens)
 *   p_ptr->run_break_right (wall on the right, stop if it opens)
 *
 * When running begins, these conditions are initialized by examining
 * the grids adjacent to the requested destination grid (marked 'x'),
 * two on each side (marked 'L' and 'R').  If either one of the two
 * grids on a given side is a wall, then that side is considered to
 * be "closed".  Both sides enclosed yields a hallway.
 *
 *    LL                     @L
 *    @x      (normal)       RxL   (diagonal)
 *    RR      (east)          R    (south-east)
 *
 * In the diagram below, in which the player is running east along a
 * hallway, he will stop as indicated before attempting to enter the
 * intersection (marked 'x').  Starting a new run in any direction
 * will begin a new hallway run.
 *
 * #.#
 * ##.##
 * o@x..
 * ##.##
 * #.#
 *
 * Note that a minor hack is inserted to make the angled corridor
 * entry (with one side blocked near and the other side blocked
 * further away from the runner) work correctly. The runner moves
 * diagonally, but then saves the previous direction as being
 * straight into the gap. Otherwise, the tail end of the other
 * entry would be perceived as an alternative on the next move.
 *
 * In the diagram below, the player is running east down a hallway,
 * and will stop in the grid (marked '1') before the intersection.
 * Continuing the run to the south-east would result in a long run
 * stopping at the end of the hallway (marked '2').
 *
 * ##################
 * o@x       1
 * ########### ######
 * #2          #
 * #############
 *
 * After each step, the surroundings are examined to determine if
 * the running should stop, and to determine if the running should
 * change direction.  We examine the new current player location
 * (at which the runner has just arrived) and the direction from
 * which the runner is considered to have come.
 *
 * Moving one grid in some direction places you adjacent to three
 * or five new grids (for straight and diagonal moves respectively)
 * to which you were not previously adjacent (marked as '!').
 *
 *   ...!              ...
 *   .o@!  (normal)    .o.!  (diagonal)
 *   ...!  (east)      ..@!  (south east)
 *                      !!!
 *
 * If any of the newly adjacent grids are "interesting" (monsters,
 * objects, some terrain features) then running stops.
 *
 * If any of the newly adjacent grids seem to be open, and you are
 * looking for a break on that side, then running stops.
 *
 * If any of the newly adjacent grids do not seem to be open, and
 * you are in an open area, and the non-open side was previously
 * entirely open, then running stops.
 *
 * If you are in a hallway, then the algorithm must determine if
 * the running should continue, turn, or stop.  If only one of the
 * newly adjacent grids appears to be open, then running continues
 * in that direction, turning if necessary.  If there are more than
 * two possible choices, then running stops.  If there are exactly
 * two possible choices, separated by a grid which does not seem
 * to be open, then running stops.  Otherwise, as shown below, the
 * player has probably reached a "corner".
 *
 *    ###             o##
 *    o@x  (normal)   #@!   (diagonal)
 *    ##!  (east)     ##x   (south east)
 *
 * In this situation, there will be two newly adjacent open grids,
 * one touching the player on a diagonal, and one directly adjacent.
 * We must consider the two "option" grids further out (marked '?').
 * We assign "option" to the straight-on grid, and "option2" to the
 * diagonal grid.  For some unknown reason, we assign "check_dir" to
 * the grid marked 's', which may be incorrectly labelled.
 *
 *    ###s
 *    o@x?   (may be incorrect diagram!)
 *    ##!?
 *
 * If both "option" grids are closed, then there is no reason to enter
 * the corner, and so we can cut the corner, by moving into the other
 * grid (diagonally).  If we choose not to cut the corner, then we may
 * go straight, but we pretend that we got there by moving diagonally.
 * Below, we avoid the obvious grid (marked 'x') and cut the corner
 * instead (marked 'n').
 *
 *    ###:               o##
 *    o@x#   (normal)    #@n    (maybe?)
 *    ##n#   (east)      ##x#
 *                       ####
 *
 * If one of the "option" grids is open, then we may have a choice, so
 * we check to see whether it is a potential corner or an intersection
 * (or room entrance).  If the grid two spaces straight ahead, and the
 * space marked with 's' are both open, then it is a potential corner
 * and we enter it if requested.  Otherwise, we stop, because it is
 * not a corner, and is instead an intersection or a room entrance.
 *
 *    ###
 *    o@x
 *    ##!#
 *
 * I do not think this documentation is correct.
