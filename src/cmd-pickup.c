 * Pick up objects and treasure on the floor.  -LM-
 *
 * Scan the list of objects in that floor grid. Pick up gold automatically.
 * Pick up objects automatically until backpack space is full if
 * auto-pickup option is on, otherwise, store objects on
 * floor in an array, and tally both how many there are and can be picked up.
 *
 * If not picking up anything, indicate objects on the floor.  Do the same
 * thing if we don't have room for anything.
 *
 * Pick up multiple objects using Tim Baker's menu system.   Recursively
 * call this function (forcing menus for any number of objects) until
 * objects are gone, backpack is full, or player is satisfied.
 *
 * We keep track of number of objects picked up to calculate time spent.
 * This tally is incremented even for automatic pickup, so we are careful
 * (in "dungeon.c" and elsewhere) to handle pickup as either a separate
 * automated move or a no-cost part of the stay still or 'g'et command.
 *
 * Note the lack of chance for the character to be disturbed by unmarked
 * objects.  They are truly "unknown".
 *
 * \param obj is the object to pick up.
 * \param menu is whether to present a menu to the player
