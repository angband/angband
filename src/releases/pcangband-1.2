Background
==========
Version 1.2 of PCAngband was released on 20th May 1993.  It was one of a series of releases for the PC made by Charles Teague based on his port of [Frog-knows](http://rephial.org/release/2.4.fk), and the first to contain new features and improvements beyond simple bugfixes.  All the features added in this release eventually made their way into the "main" game.

Changelist
==============
Features
--------
 - The look command has been improved to give some idea of how hurt a monster is, with five levels ranging from unhurt to almost dead (with equivalents for unliving monsters).
 - A rod of Trap Detection has been added to make warriors more playable.
 - An autoroller has been added, adapted from another Moria spinoff, Druid Moria.
 - High score display colorized to highlight your score.
 - You can now write out your character description to a file from the tombstone screen
 - *Enlightenment* potions now provide self-knowledge as well as their other powers. 

Bugfixes
--------
 - Wizard mode characters no longer included in the highscore table.
 - Deletion from the highscore table now works properly.
 - Summoned group monsters are all lit properly
 - No need to use 'g' key to enter a shop
 - Quest code fixed so that killing a quest monster (Sauron) out of depth 	still completes the quest
 - No trap doors on (uncompleted) quest levels
 - Arkenstone will not be harmed by silver jellys
 - Curse Weapon and Curse Armor scrolls fixed
