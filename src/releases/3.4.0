Background
==========
Angband 3.4.0 was released on 14th September 2012, almost a year after the previous version.  Over the previous year, there was extensive discussion about the game having become much easier compared to 2.9.0, or even 3.0.9, and this resulted in a drive to make the game harder.  However, this was not the sole focus of this release and there were many other large changes too:

* A new 64x64 tile set (by Shockbolt)
* Many new monster pits and nests
* Fuzzy detection of objects
* Upgrade to UTF-8
* Angels replaced with Ainu
* Removal of all weakly cursed items
* Torches now radius 1 light
* Changes to monster summoning
* Deep descent scrolls became more dangerous
* New OS X frontend using Cocoa

After this release, the pace of change in the game dropped dramatically.  This is partly because of the birth of two competing projects: v4, an offshoot of V, and Pyrel, an attempt at rewriting Angband in Python.  Both of these were being contributed to by the same development team that had formed around Angband, and as a result Angband development dropped off after this release, with the previously regular changes in 'nightly' builds being reduced to a trickle at best.
