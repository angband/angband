Background
===========
Version 2.9.2 was released on 12th February 2001 by Robert R&uuml;hlmann.

Changelist
==========
 - Fixed several security problems (buffer overflows, tempfile-races,
   reading files that the player has no permission to read, and incorrect or
   missing bounds-checking).
 - Splitted the lib/user/ folder into lib/pref/ for the default "pref files"
   that are distributed with the game, and lib/user/ (or ~/.angband/Angband/
   on multi-user systems) for files created by the user.
 - Added extra status information (stunned, asleep, ...) when looking at
   monsters.
 - Added context sensitive help to the options screen (press '?' to get info
   about an option).
 - Made the "hitpoint warning" message orange by default, so that it's
   easier to spot.
 -  Updated the helpfiles a bit.
 - The names of the generated vaults are now displayed when the cheat_room
   option is turned on.
 - Added support for poison branded ego weapons (but no poison branded
   weapons exist yet).
 - The helpfile display now supports links to specific sections of a
   helpfile.
 - The helpfile display, knowlegde screen, and message history can now
   use screens bigger than the default 80x24.
 - The dungeon coordinates are now displayed when targetting in wizard mode.
 - Improved error-checking for savefile loading and *_info.txt parsing.
 - Intrinsic immunities of the player are now displayed in the character
   sheet.
 - The "known uniques" list displays the number of killed uniques.
 - Fixed a bug that messed up the description of the "genocide" artifact
   activation.
 - The activation of Avavir works correctly now.
 - The Bubbles vault no longer has inaccessible areas.
 - Changed the description for experience drain attacks of monsters.
 - The random character generation restricts the class to the "legal"
   choices for the player's race.
 - The "word of recall" artifact activation didn't check the ironman option.
 - Exiting Angband explicitly frees all allocated memory now.
 - Artifacts are now inscribed {indestructible} when the player tries to
   destroy them and pseudo-id can improve this to {special} or {terrible}
   later.
 - Killing Morgoth will now create a down staircase.
 - Increased the variable size for the weight carried by the player to
   prevent problems with carrying huge amounts of stuff.
 - The debug mode command to change the number of items does now properly
   adjust the weight carried by the player.
 - The game is now saved before printing the tombstone, not after.  That
   makes cheating by killing the process a little bit harder.
 - The input is now flushed before verifying casting prayers or spells
   without enough mana to prevent accidential "overcasting".
 - Fixed a bug that prevented redefining the keymaps of the number keys from
   working correctly if the keymap contained another number.
 - Fixed a bug that allowed the player to see the flavor of an item in a
   store when examining it.
 - Fixed a bug that sometimes didn't update the maximum player level
   correctly.
 - Made the 'Crown' vault a "Greater vault".
 - Marked the 'randomize artifacts' options as "beta".
 - Corrected the displayed duration for "essence of speed" and "globe of
   invulnerability".
 - Fixed a bug that could cause the initial offer required when haggling
   to be wrong.
 - Fixed a rare bug that could cause the game to lockup when resting in town
   for a long time.
 - Fixed the formatting of the object spoilers.
 - Completely changed the window resizing behaviour in the Windows version.
 - Added support to use Angband+APWBorg as a screensaver in Windows.
 - Added support for the new version of the Cygwin compiler for Windows.
 - Menu entries in the Windows version are now disabled in situations where
   they don't make sense.
 - Fixed a bug in the DOS version that caused midi-file playing to stop
   after the first song.
 - Updated the Amiga files.
 -  Fixed a compile problem in the Mac version.
 - The loading of bitmap files in the X11 version is no longer dependent on
   the byte-order of the machine.
 - Improved the speed of the gamma-correction code in the X11 version.
 - Added autoconf support (beta) for Unix/Linux.
 - Added a compile time option to prevent users from changing the path to
   the Angband files.
 - Added very basic support for GTK+.
 - Exiting the curses version properly cleans up the term now.
 - The X11/XAW version starts with only one window by default.
