Background
==========
Angband 3.3.2 was released on 29th October 2011, as another bugfix 
release in the 3.3.x series.

Changes
=======
Unfortunately a mistake in the fix for #1515 caused a nasty bug (#1545)
where both hasting and slowing of monsters stopped working. This is
fixed, along with some or all of the Windows numpad errors (#1494,
thanks to Blubaron). Also fixed a minor bug with origin setting of gold
in special rooms, and fixed some randart issues (broken supercharges, no
RES_STUN - #1553 - thanks PowerWyrm). Also finally removed those pesky
randart error messages!
