To build Angband using Microsoft's Visual Studio.

 1. Download the source from the homepage at http://rephial.org or clone the
    git repostitory at https://github.com/angband/angband.

 2. Make an empty win32 project in visual studio.

 3. Extract/copy the source code into the project directory. Make sure that 
    the src directory is in the project directory, rather than in another
    subdirectory.

 4. Rename src\player\util.c to src\player\p-util.c or something like that.

 5. Copy libpng.dll and zlib1.dll from src\win\dll\ to the project directory.

 6. In the project settings, in the C/C++ tab, in the additional include
    directories ilne, add: src, src/win, src/win/include.

 7. In the project settings, in the Link tab, in the Object/library modules
    line, add: "src\win\zlib1.lib src\win\libpng.lib winmm.lib " to the front
    of the line.

 8. In the project settings, also in the Link tab, remove any directory names
    (usually Debug\ or Release\) from in front of the executable name. Doing
    this will put the executeable in the project directory so you do not have
    to move it every time the project is compiled.

 9. Add all of the files that end in ".c" or ".h" in the src directory EXCEPT
    those that have "main" in their name and snd-sdl.c to the project files.
    This can be done by right-clicking on the project in visual studio and 
    choosing "Add Files to Project" from the context menu or by going to
    "Project" -> "Add to Project" -> "Files" from the menu bar.

10. Add all of the files that end in ".c" or ".h" in the src\player directory
    to the project.

11. Add all of the files that end in ".c" or ".h" in the src\object directory
    to the project.

12. Add all of the files that end in ".c" or ".h" in the src\monster directory
    to the project.

13. Add all of the files that end in ".c" or ".h" in the src\win directory
    to the project, as well as angband.rc.

14. Add main-win.c from the src directory to the project.

15. Save the project, then compile the project. There will be a lot of
    warnings, but there should not be any errors. The warnings can be ignored.

16. If there are no errors, enjoy playing angband. There should not be any
    errors and the executable should be built. If there are any errors, and
    you do not know how to fix them, you can ask on the forums at
    http://angband.oook.cz or in the #angband-dev IRC channel on Freenode.

17. Report bugs or request changes at trac.rephial.org.

18. To submit bug fixes, changes, etc please open pull requests on the Github
    site.
