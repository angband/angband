/**
 * Defines the default paths to the Angband directories, for ports that use
 * the main.c file.
 *
 * "config path" is for per-installation configurable data, like the game's
 * edit files and system-wide preferences.
 *
 * "lib path" is for static data, like sounds, graphics and fonts.
 *
 * "data path" is for variable data, like save files and scores. On single-
 * user systems, this also includes user preferences and dumps (on multi-
 * user systems these go under the user's home directory).
 *
 * The configure script overrides these values. Check the "--prefix=<dir>"
 * option of the configure script.
 *
 * These values will be over-ridden by the "ANGBAND_PATH" environment
 * variable, if that variable is defined and accessible.  The final
 * "slash" is required if the value supplied is in fact a directory.
 *
 * Using the value "./lib/" below tells Angband that, by default,
 * the user will run "angband" from the same directory that contains
 * the "lib" directory.  This is a reasonable (but imperfect) default.
 *
 * If at all possible, you should change this value to refer to the
 * actual location of the folders, for example, "/etc/angband/"
 * or "/usr/share/angband/", or "/var/games/angband/". In fact, if at all
 * possible you should use a packaging system which does this for you.
 *
 * N.B. The data path is only used if USE_PRIVATE_PATHS is not defined.
 * The other two are always used.
