/**
 * A simple, fast, integer-based line-of-sight algorithm.  By Joseph Hall,
 * 4116 Brewster Drive, Raleigh NC 27606.  Email to jnh@ecemwl.ncsu.edu.
 *
 * This function returns true if a "line of sight" can be traced from the
 * center of the grid (x1,y1) to the center of the grid (x2,y2), with all
 * of the grids along this path (except for the endpoints) being non-wall
 * grids.  Actually, the "chess knight move" situation is handled by some
 * special case code which allows the grid diagonally next to the player
 * to be obstructed, because this yields better gameplay semantics.  This
 * algorithm is totally reflexive, except for "knight move" situations.
 *
 * Because this function uses (short) ints for all calculations, overflow
 * may occur if dx and dy exceed 90.
 *
 * Once all the degenerate cases are eliminated, we determine the "slope"
 * ("m"), and we use special "fixed point" mathematics in which we use a
 * special "fractional component" for one of the two location components
 * ("qy" or "qx"), which, along with the slope itself, are "scaled" by a
 * scale factor equal to "abs(dy*dx*2)" to keep the math simple.  Then we
 * simply travel from start to finish along the longer axis, starting at
 * the border between the first and second tiles (where the y offset is
 * thus half the slope), using slope and the fractional component to see
 * when motion along the shorter axis is necessary.  Since we assume that
 * vision is not blocked by "brushing" the corner of any grid, we must do
 * some special checks to avoid testing grids which are "brushed" but not
 * actually "entered".
 *
 * Angband three different "line of sight" type concepts, including this
 * function (which is used almost nowhere), the "project()" method (which
 * is used for determining the paths of projectables and spells and such),
 * and the "update_view()" concept (which is used to determine which grids
 * are "viewable" by the player, which is used for many things, such as
 * determining which grids are illuminated by the player's torch, and which
 * grids and monsters can be "seen" by the player, etc).

/**
 * The comments below are still predominantly true, and have been left
 * (slightly modified for accuracy) for historical and nostalgic reasons.
 *
 * Some comments on the dungeon related data structures and functions...
 *
 * Angband is primarily a dungeon exploration game, and it should come as
 * no surprise that the internal representation of the dungeon has evolved
 * over time in much the same way as the game itself, to provide semantic
 * changes to the game itself, to make the code simpler to understand, and
 * to make the executable itself faster or more efficient in various ways.
 *
 * There are a variety of dungeon related data structures, and associated
 * functions, which store information about the dungeon, and provide methods
 * by which this information can be accessed or modified.
 *
 * Some of this information applies to the dungeon as a whole, such as the
 * list of unique monsters which are still alive.  Some of this information
 * only applies to the current dungeon level, such as the current depth, or
 * the list of monsters currently inhabiting the level.  And some of the
 * information only applies to a single grid of the current dungeon level,
 * such as whether the grid is illuminated, or whether the grid contains a
 * monster, or whether the grid can be seen by the player.  If Angband was
 * to be turned into a multi-player game, some of the information currently
 * associated with the dungeon should really be associated with the player,
 * such as whether a given grid is viewable by a given player.
 *
 * Currently, a lot of the information about the dungeon is stored in ways
 * that make it very efficient to access or modify the information, while
 * still attempting to be relatively conservative about memory usage, even
 * if this means that some information is stored in multiple places, or in
 * ways which require the use of special code idioms.  For example, each
 * monster record in the monster array contains the location of the monster,
 * and each cave grid has an index into the monster array, or a zero if no
 * monster is in the grid.  This allows the monster code to efficiently see
 * where the monster is located, while allowing the dungeon code to quickly
 * determine not only if a monster is present in a given grid, but also to
 * find out which monster.  The extra space used to store the information
 * twice is inconsequential compared to the speed increase.
 *
 * Several pieces of information about each cave grid are stored in the
 * info field of the "cave->squares" array, which is a special array of
 * bitflags.
 *
 * The "SQUARE_ROOM" flag is used to determine which grids are part of "rooms", 
 * and thus which grids are affected by "illumination" spells.
 *
 * The "SQUARE_VAULT" flag is used to determine which grids are part of 
 * "vaults", and thus which grids cannot serve as the destinations of player 
 * teleportation.
 *
 * The "SQUARE_GLOW" flag is used to determine which grids are "permanently 
 * illuminated".  This flag is used by the update_view() function to help 
 * determine which viewable flags may be "seen" by the player.  This flag 
 * is used by the "map_info" function to determine if a grid is only lit by 
 * the player's torch.  This flag has special semantics for wall grids 
 * (see "update_view()").
 *
 * The "SQUARE_VIEW" flag is used to determine which grids are currently in
 * line of sight of the player.  This flag is set by (and used by) the
 * "update_view()" function.  This flag is used by any code which needs to
 * know if the player can "view" a given grid.  This flag is used by the
 * "map_info()" function for some optional special lighting effects.  The
 * "player_has_los_bold()" macro wraps an abstraction around this flag, but
 * certain code idioms are much more efficient.  This flag is used to check
 * if a modification to a terrain feature might affect the player's field of
 * view.  This flag is used to see if certain monsters are "visible" to the
 * player.  This flag is used to allow any monster in the player's field of
 * view to "sense" the presence of the player.
 *
 * The "SQUARE_SEEN" flag is used to determine which grids are currently in
 * line of sight of the player and also illuminated in some way.  This flag
 * is set by the "update_view()" function, using computations based on the
 * "SQUARE_VIEW" and "SQUARE_GLOW" flags and terrain of various grids.  
 * This flag is used by any code which needs to know if the player can "see" a
 * given grid.  This flag is used by the "map_info()" function both to see
 * if a given "boring" grid can be seen by the player, and for some optional
 * special lighting effects.  The "player_can_see_bold()" macro wraps an
 * abstraction around this flag, but certain code idioms are much more
 * efficient.  This flag is used to see if certain monsters are "visible" to
 * the player.  This flag is never set for a grid unless "SQUARE_VIEW" is also
 * set for the grid.  Whenever the terrain or "SQUARE_GLOW" flag changes
 * for a grid which has the "SQUARE_VIEW" flag set, the "SQUARE_SEEN" flag must
 * be recalculated.  The simplest way to do this is to call "forget_view()"
 * and "update_view()" whenever the terrain or "SQUARE_GLOW" flag changes
 * for a grid which has "SQUARE_VIEW" set.
 *
 * The "SQUARE_WASSEEN" flag is used for a variety of temporary purposes.  This
 * flag is used to determine if the "SQUARE_SEEN" flag for a grid has changed
 * during the "update_view()" function.  This flag is used to "spread" light
 * or darkness through a room.  This flag is used by the "monster flow code".
 * This flag must always be cleared by any code which sets it.
 *
 * The "update_view()" function is an extremely important function.  It is
 * called only when the player moves, significant terrain changes, or the
 * player's blindness or torch radius changes.  Note that when the player
 * is resting, or performing any repeated actions (like digging, disarming,
 * farming, etc), there is no need to call the "update_view()" function, so
 * even if it was not very efficient, this would really only matter when the
 * player was "running" through the dungeon.  It sets the "SQUARE_VIEW" flag
 * on every cave grid in the player's field of view.  It also checks the torch
 * radius of the player, and sets the "SQUARE_SEEN" flag for every grid which
 * is in the "field of view" of the player and which is also "illuminated",
 * either by the players torch (if any) or by any permanent light source.
 * It could use and help maintain information about multiple light sources,
 * which would be helpful in a multi-player version of Angband.
 *
 * Note that the "update_view()" function allows, among other things, a room
 * to be "partially" seen as the player approaches it, with a growing cone
 * of floor appearing as the player gets closer to the door.  Also, by not
 * turning on the "memorize perma-lit grids" option, the player will only
 * "see" those floor grids which are actually in line of sight.  And best
 * of all, you can now activate the special lighting effects to indicate
 * which grids are actually in the player's field of view by using dimmer
 * colors for grids which are not in the player's field of view, and/or to
 * indicate which grids are illuminated only by the player's torch by using
 * the color yellow for those grids.
 *
 * It seems as though slight modifications to the "update_view()" functions
 * would allow us to determine "reverse" line-of-sight as well as "normal"
 * line-of-sight", which would allow monsters to have a more "correct" way
 * to determine if they can "see" the player, since right now, they "cheat"
 * somewhat and assume that if the player has "line of sight" to them, then
 * they can "pretend" that they have "line of sight" to the player.  But if
 * such a change was attempted, the monsters would actually start to exhibit
 * some undesirable behavior, such as "freezing" near the entrances to long
 * hallways containing the player, and code would have to be added to make
 * the monsters move around even if the player was not detectable, and to
 * "remember" where the player was last seen, to avoid looking stupid.
 *
 * Note that the "SQUARE_GLOW" flag means that a grid is permanently lit in
 * some way.  However, for the player to "see" the grid, as determined by
 * the "SQUARE_SEEN" flag, the player must not be blind, the grid must have
 * the "SQUARE_VIEW" flag set, and if the grid is a "wall" grid, and it is
 * not lit by the player's torch, then it must touch a projectable grid 
 * which has both the "SQUARE_GLOW"
 * and "SQUARE_VIEW" flags set.  This last part about wall grids is induced
 * by the semantics of "SQUARE_GLOW" as applied to wall grids, and checking
 * the technical requirements can be very expensive, especially since the
 * grid may be touching some "illegal" grids.  Luckily, it is more or less
 * correct to restrict the "touching" grids from the eight "possible" grids
 * to the (at most) three grids which are touching the grid, and which are
 * closer to the player than the grid itself, which eliminates more than
 * half of the work, including all of the potentially "illegal" grids, if
 * at most one of the three grids is a "diagonal" grid.  In addition, in
 * almost every situation, it is possible to ignore the "SQUARE_VIEW" flag
 * on these three "touching" grids, for a variety of technical reasons.
 * Finally, note that in most situations, it is only necessary to check
 * a single "touching" grid, in fact, the grid which is strictly closest
 * to the player of all the touching grids, and in fact, it is normally
 * only necessary to check the "SQUARE_GLOW" flag of that grid, again, for
 * various technical reasons.  However, one of the situations which does
 * not work with this last reduction is the very common one in which the
 * player approaches an illuminated room from a dark hallway, in which the
 * two wall grids which form the "entrance" to the room would not be marked
 * as "SQUARE_SEEN", since of the three "touching" grids nearer to the player
 * than each wall grid, only the farthest of these grids is itself marked
 * "SQUARE_GLOW".
 *
 *
 * Here are some pictures of the legal "light source" radius values, in
 * which the numbers indicate the "order" in which the grids could have
 * been calculated, if desired.  Note that the code will work with larger
 * radiuses, though currently yields such a radius, and the game would
 * become slower in some situations if it did.
