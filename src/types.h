/*
 * Note that "char" may or may not be signed, and that "signed char"
 * may or may not work on all machines.  So always use "s16b" or "s32b"
 * for signed values.  Also, note that unsigned values cause math problems
 * in many cases, so try to only use "u16b" and "u32b" for "bit flags",
 * unless you really need the extra bit of information, or you really
 * need to restrict yourself to a single byte for storage reasons.
 *
 * Also, if possible, attempt to restrict yourself to sub-fields of
 * known size (use "s16b" or "s32b" instead of "int", and "byte" instead
 * of "bool"), and attempt to align all fields along four-byte words, to
 * optimize storage issues on 32-bit machines.  Also, avoid "bit flags"
 * since these increase the code size and slow down execution.  When
 * you need to store bit flags, use one byte per flag, or, where space
 * is an issue, use a "byte" or "u16b" or "u32b", and add special code
 * to access the various bit flags.
 *
 * Many of these structures were developed to reduce the number of global
 * variables, facilitate structured program design, allow the use of ascii
 * template files, simplify access to indexed data, or facilitate efficient
 * clearing of many variables at once.
 *
 * Certain data is saved in multiple places for efficient access, currently,
 * this includes the tval/sval/weight fields in "object_type", various fields
 * in "header_type", and the "m_idx" and "o_idx" fields in "cave_type".  All
 * of these could be removed, but this would, in general, slow down the game
 * and increase the complexity of the code.

/*
 * Template file header information (see "init.c").  16 bytes.
 *
 * Note that the sizes of many of the "arrays" are between 32768 and
 * 65535, and so we must use "unsigned" values to hold the "sizes" of
 * these arrays below.  Normally, I try to avoid using unsigned values,
 * since they can cause all sorts of bizarre problems, but I have no
 * choice here, at least, until the "race" array is split into "normal"
 * and "unique" monsters, which may or may not actually help.
 *
 * Note that, on some machines, for example, the Macintosh, the standard
 * "read()" and "write()" functions cannot handle more than 32767 bytes
 * at one time, so we need replacement functions, see "util.c" for details.
 *
 * Note that, on some machines, for example, the Macintosh, the standard
 * "malloc()" function cannot handle more than 32767 bytes at one time,
 * but we may assume that the "ralloc()" function can handle up to 65535
 * butes at one time.  We should not, however, assume that the "ralloc()"
 * function can handle more than 65536 bytes at a time, since this might
 * result in segmentation problems on certain older machines, and in fact,
 * we should not assume that it can handle exactly 65536 bytes at a time,
 * since the internal functions may use an unsigned short to specify size.
 *
 * In general, these problems occur only on machines (such as most personal
 * computers) which use 2 byte "int" values, and which use "int" for the
 * arguments to the relevent functions.

 *
 * The "o_idx" and "m_idx" fields are very interesting.  There are
 * many places in the code where we need quick access to the actual
 * monster or object(s) in a given cave grid.  The easiest way to
 * do this is to simply keep the index of the monster and object
 * (if any) with the grid, but this takes 198*66*4 bytes of memory.
 * Several other methods come to mind, which require only half this
 * amound of memory, but they all seem rather complicated, and would
 * probably add enough code that the savings would be lost.  So for
 * these reasons, we simply store an index into the "o_list" and
 * "m_list" arrays, using "zero" when no monster/object is present.
 *
 * Note that "o_idx" is the index of the top object in a stack of
 * objects, using the "next_o_idx" field of objects (see below) to
 * create the singly linked list of objects.  If "o_idx" is zero
 * then there are no objects in the grid.
