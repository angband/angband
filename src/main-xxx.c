#include "angband.h"


/*
 * This file helps Angband work on non-existant computers.
 *
 * To use this file, use "Makefile.xxx", which defines USE_XXX.
 *
 *
 * This file is intended to show one way to build a "visual module"
 * for Angband to allow it to work with a new system.  It does not
 * actually work, but if the code near "XXX XXX XXX" comments were
 * replaced with functional code, then it probably would.
 *
 * See "z-term.c" for info on the concept of the "generic terminal",
 * and for more comments about what this file must supply.
 *
 * There are two basic ways to port Angband to a new system.  The
 * first involves modifying the "main-gcu.c" and/or "main-x11.c"
 * files to support some version of "curses" and/or "X11" on your
 * machine, and to compile with the "USE_GCU" and/or "USE_X11"
 * compilation flags defined.  The second involves creating a
 * new "main-xxx.c" file, based on this sample file (or on any
 * existing "main-xxx.c" file), and comes in two flavors, based
 * on whether it contains a "main()" function (as in "main-mac.c"
 * and "main-win.c") or not (as in "main-gcu.c" or "main-x11.c").
 *
 * If the "main-xxx.c" file includes its own "main()" function,
 * then you should NOT link in the "main.c" file, and your "main()"
 * function must process any command line arguments, initialize the
 * "visual system", and call "play_game()" with appropriate arguments.
 *
 * If the "main-xxx.c" file does not include its own "main()"
 * function, then you must add some code to "main.c" which, if
 * the appropriate "USE_XXX" compilation flag is defined, will
 * attempt to call the "init_xxx()" function in the "main-xxx.c"
 * file, which should initialize the "visual system" and return
 * zero if it was successful.  The "main()" function in "main.c"
 * will take care of processing command line arguments and then
 * calling "play_game()" with appropriate arguments.
 *
 * Note that the "util.c" file often contains functions which must
 * be modified in small ways for various platforms, even if you are
 * able to use the existing "main-gcu.c" and/or "main-x11.c" files,
 * in particular, the "file handling" functions may not work on all
 * systems.
 *
 * When you complete a port to a new system, you should email any
 * newly created files, and any changes made to existing files,
 * including "h-config.h", "config.h", and any of the "Makefile"
 * files, to "rr9@thangorodrim.net" for inclusion in the next version.
 *
 * Always choose a "three letter" naming scheme for "main-xxx.c"
 * and "Makefile.xxx" and such for consistency and simplicity.
 *
 *
 * Initial framework (and all code) by Ben Harrison (benh@phial.com).
