/*
 * Flags for the "info" field of grids
 *
 * Note that some of the flags below are not "perfect", in particular,
 * several of the flags should be treated as "best guesses", see below.
 *
 * The "BORG_MARK" flag means that the grid has been "observed", though
 * the terrain feature may or may not be memorized.  Note the use of the
 * "FEAT_NONE" and "FEAT_FLOOR" feature codes below.
 *
 * The "BORG_GLOW" flag means that a grid is probably "perma-lit", but
 * sometimes it is really only "recently" perma-lit, but was then made
 * dark with a darkness attack, and it is now torch-lit or off-screen.
 *
 * The "BORG_DARK" flag means that a grid is probably not "perma-lit",
 * but sometimes it is really only "recently" dark, but was then made
 * "lite" with a "call lite" spell, and it is now torch-lit or off-screen.
 *
 * The "BORG_LIGHT" flag means that a grid is probably lit by the player
 * torch, but this may not be true if the nearby "BORG_VIEW" flags are
 * not correct, or if the "lite radius" has changed recently.
 *
 * The "BORG_VIEW" flag means that a grid is probably in line of sight
 * of the player, but this may not be true if some of the grids between
 * the player and the grid contain previously unseen walls/doors/etc.
 *
 * The "BORG_TEMP" flag means that a grid has been added to the array
 * "borg_temp_x"/"borg_temp_y", though normally we ignore this flag.
 *
 * The "BORG_XTRA" flag is used for various "extra" purposes, primarily
 * to assist with the "update_view()" code.
