/*
 * A grid in the dungeon.
 *
 * There is a terrain feature type, which may be incorrect.  It is
 * more or less based on the standard "feature" values, but some of
 * the legal values are never used, such as "secret door", and others
 * are used in bizarre ways, such as "invisible trap".
 *
 * There is an object (take) index into the "object tracking" array.
 *
 * There is a monster (kill) index into the "monster tracking" array.
 *
 * There is a byte "xtra" which tracks how much "searching" has been done
 * in the grid or in any grid next to the grid.
 *
 * To perform "navigation" from one place to another, the "flow" routines
 * are used, which place "cost" information into the "cost" fields.  Then,
 * if the path is clear, the "cost" information is copied into the "flow"
 * fields, which are used for the actual navigation.  This allows multiple
 * routines to check for "possible" flowing, without hurting the current
 * flow, which may have taken a long time to construct.  We also assume
 * that the Borg never needs to follow a path longer than 250 grids long.
 * Note that the "cost" fields have been moved into external arrays.
 *
 * traps and glyphs are now separate flags
 *
 * Hack -- note that the "char" zero will often crash the system!
