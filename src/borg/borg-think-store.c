 * This processing handles the highest level goals, and store interaction.
 *
 * Store interaction strategy
 *
 *   (1) Sell items to the home (for later use)
 ** optimize the stuff in the home... this involves buying and selling stuff
 ** not in the 'best' list.
 *       We sell anything we may need later (see step 4)
 *
 *   (2) Sell items to the shops (for money)
 *       We sell anything we do not actually need
 *
 *   (3) Buy items from the shops (for the player)
 *       We buy things that we actually need
 *
 *   (4) Buy items from the home (for the player)
 *       We buy things that we actually need (see step 1)
 *
 *   (5) Buy items from the shops (for the home)
 *       We buy things we may need later (see step 1)
 *
 *   (6) Buy items from the home (for the stores)
 *       We buy things we no longer need (see step 2)
 *
 *   The basic principle is that we should always act to improve our
 *   "status", and we should sometimes act to "maintain" our status,
 *   especially if there is a monetary reward.  But first we should
 *   attempt to use the home as a "stockpile", even though that is
 *   not worth any money, since it may save us money eventually.

/* (This routine is copied from store.c
 * Determine the price of an object (qty one) in a store.
 *
 *  store_buying == true  means the shop is buying, player selling
 *               == false means the shop is selling, player buying
 *
 * This function takes into account the player's charisma, but
 * never lets a shop-keeper lose money in a transaction.
 *
 * The "greed" value should exceed 100 when the player is "buying" the
 * object, and should be less than 100 when the player is "selling" it.
