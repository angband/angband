     * proposed defense spell.  The result will be the borg will
     * not cast the resistance spell even though it may be a very
     * good idea.
     *
     * Example: a monster has three breath attacks (Fire, Ice,
     * Disenchant) and each hits for 800 pts of damage.  The
     * borg currently resists all three, so the danger would be
     * 500. If the borg were to use a Res Heat Potion that would
     * decrease the danger to:
     * Fire:  333
     * Ice:   500
     * Disen: 500
     * Now the Average is 444.  Not really worth it, nominal change.
     * But if the resistance spell was both Fire and Ice, then
     * it would be:
     * Fire:  333
     * Ice:   333
     * Disen: 500
     * With an average of 388. Probably worth it, but the borg
     * would see that the Disen attack is a quite dangerous and
     * would return the result of 500.
     *
     * To fix this, the flag 'average' is added to the
     * borg_danger() to skip this check and return the average
     * damage.  If the flag is false then the formula below is
     * SKIPPED and the value returned with be the average.
     * If the flag is true, then the formula below will be used
     * to determine the returned value.  Currently the elemental
     * resistance spells and PFE have the flag set as false.
