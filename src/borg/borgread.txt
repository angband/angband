Greetings my friends and welcome to the world of mindless dribble.
This source code will enable you to spend countless hours staring
at your computer when you should be doing something more productive,
anything more productive.

You have a couple of options on how to get the borg running.  Be sure
to copy the file borg.txt into the angband\lib\user  directory.  On
my system, borg.txt is in c:\games\ang309\lib\user.

For those using Unix, you need to put it in a different directory.
The borg.txt file ought to be placed in the directory ~/.angband/Angband/ on Unix systems. 

Option one:  
Use the precompiled executable files and replace your
angband.exe or angband.scr files with the ones with this package.
1. copy the angband.exe and replace the existing one in your angband
   directory.  If using the screensaver, copy and replace the
   angband.scr in your windows directory.
2. If using screensaver, copy the angband.ini included with the screensaver
   zip file and put that in your windows directory as well.  Be sure to 
   edit it so it points to the correct location of your angband files.
   (See the notes below)
   

Option two:  Compile your own executable file using the borg source
     code provided in this package.  Follow the instructions below.

To install and compile this borg, you will need to do the following:
1.  Modify the config.h to uncomment:
        a. the allow_borg line
        b. the score_borg line
        c. the allow_borg_graphics line
2.  Modify the makefile to include the borg1.o (or borg1.obj if windows)
    though borg9.o
3.  Make sure the file borg.txt is located in the \lib\user\ directory.
    Unless you are using unix.  Unix users must have it in a specially 
    named directory, but I don't remember what it is.
4.  Modify your borg.txt file if you want to run the borg in a particular
    fashion, including continuous play borgs.
5.  Compile
6.  Start the game, load up a character or make new one.
7.  Hit control z, read and ignore the messages, hit z again.
8.  Grab some popcorn and a soda, and watch your mind go numb.

The borg may get stuck in certain situations.  He may have a Clock Overflow.
He may loop buying and selling the same stuff over and over.  Believe me
when I say that these have been addressed.  His loops are greatly reduced.

Continuous Play Mode: (option)
Upon the death of a borg, he will automatically reroll a random character,
with a random name and start fresh from clevel 1.  To enable the Continuous
Play Mode, turn the game option cheat_live on.  To do that enter the
options by pressing the equal sign (=) then Cheat Options (6).

If you want, you can tell the borg to select a certain race and or class for
the next one rolled up.  You can make these selections from the borg.txt file.

The Continual Play Mode is NOT turned on by default, you will need to
select it.

This borg is updated frequently.  You can get the lastest source

Have Fun,

===========================
 Angband Borg Screen Saver
===========================

by Robert Ruehlmann < rr9@angband.org >
   Andrew White     < andrew@innovapain.com >
   
Uses Andrew P. White's APWBorg.
(see http://innovapain.com/borg).


Description:
------------

A screensaver that runs the vanilla Angband Windows version with the
APW Borg and automatically restarts the Borg when the character dies
(continuous play mode).

The borg engine is updated frequently, so visit Dr. White's page and
obtain the most recent version of the borg.  You may also down-load
an up to date executable of the screensaver from that page.

Note that the Angband display is not always dynamic and may not
protect your monitor from burning-in of images.  While this is highly
unlikely with modern monitors you might want to configure the energy
saving settings for your monitor so that it turns itself off after
some time of inactivity.  The screensaver will also keep the
processor and hard-disk busy.  Power-saving features that depend on
inactivity of these parts won't be effective while the screensaver
is running.  You have been warned.


Installation:
-------------

Copy angband.scr and the included angband.ini into your Windows directory.

Make sure you have the Windows version of Angband installed.
If you don't have it yet, then download it from
http://rephial.org/ and install it.  You will need all the supporting files
found in the Lib directory.

Open angband.ini with a text-editor and modify "AngbandPath" so that
it points to the directory where Angband for Windows is
installed. Note that the path has to end with a backslash ('\').

The "SaverFile" variable should contain the name of the character you
want to use for the screensaver.  A random character will be
automatically created if the character doesn't exist yet.  Note that
the savefile will be marked as cheater and won't get an highscore
entry!  

With the changes to the 3.0.9 game code, there is a slight flaw
in how the borg rolls up the first character for the screensaver.  The
character is rolled but the borg won't engage until the next time the
screensaver is activated.

It is recommended that you create a normal character using the regular
version of Angband and setup your term windows the way you like them.
Then save that file and use that file name as the "SaverFile" for your
screensaver.

For example, I have these three lines in my angband.ini file.
[Angband]
AngbandPath="c:\games\angband-3.0.9\"
SaverFile="Saver"

Test the screen saver in windows.  Select the screensaver in the 
Windows Display Properties and test it!


Technical stuff:
----------------

The screensaver is basically just a renamed Windows Angband
executable.  The main-win.c file has been heavily modified to allow
the game to act as screensaver.

"SCORE_BORGS" has been turned on so that normal Borgs (but not Borgs
used with the continuous play mode turned on like in the
screensaver!) will get highscore entries.

The screensaver uses the angband.ini of the normal Angband
installation to determine the screen-layout, as well as the graphics
and sound settings.

My "ALLOW_BORG_GRAPHICS" code that is included in the APW Borg has
been turned on, so the Borg runs nicely with the various graphics
and "view_foo_lite" lighting settings.

The screensaver can be used as normal Angband executable by renaming
it to angband.exe and replacing the old exe in the Angband 
installation directory with it.

The screensaver tries to be "nice" and only uses processor cycles
when the processor would be idle otherwise.  It shouldn't slow down
other processes that might be running.

The user can also switch that feature on with the "Options/Low
priority" menu-entry when using the screensaver as normal Angband
executable (very useful for running Borgs in the background).

Known problems:
---------------

- No preview of the screensaver when in the Windows display
  properties.
- Password protection doesn't work yet (note that Windows NT seems
  to handle password protection itself, so this might be no problem
  on NT and maybe Windows 2000 machines).
- Configuration of the screenserver should be possible with a dialog
  instead of an ini-file.
- Selecting "Show scores" while the Borg is running will probably
  crash the Borg since it can't parse the score-screen.
- The screensaver probably won't work correctly with other Borgs that
  don't provide a continuous play mode compatible with the APW code.
- Running the same savefile twice at the same time (for example by
  running a normal game and the screensaver with the same savefile)
  might lead to problems.
- The size of some info windows can increase when exiting the "pseudo-
  screensaver" mode started from the options menu.
- The Borg is a very complicated piece of code and contains lots of bugs.
  Expect slowdowns, loops, crashes, and other problems.  If you encounter
  a suspect bug, first consult the APWBorg Webpage for a updated screen-
  saver, and check the Daily Log of Changes to see if your bug has been
  fixed.  If not, then send the bug and savefile to Dr. White at
