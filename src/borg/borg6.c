/*
 * Spread a "flow" from the "destination" grids outwards
 *
 * We fill in the "cost" field of every grid that the player can
 * "reach" with the number of steps needed to reach that grid,
 * if the grid is "reachable", and otherwise, with "255", which
 * is the largest possible value that can be stored in a byte.
 *
 * Thus, certain grids which are actually "reachable" but only by
 * a path which is at least 255 steps in length will thus appear
 * to be "unreachable", but this is not a major concern.
 *
 * We use the "flow" array as a "circular queue", and thus we must
 * be careful not to allow the "queue" to "overflow".  This could
 * only happen with a large number of distinct destination points,
 * each several units away from every other destination point, and
 * in a dungeon with no walls and no dangerous monsters.  But this
 * is technically possible, so we must check for it just in case.
 *
 * We do not need a "priority queue" because the cost from grid to
 * grid is always "one" and we process them in order.  If we did
 * use a priority queue, this function might become unusably slow,
 * unless we reactivated the "room building" code.
 *
 * We handle both "walls" and "danger" by marking every grid which
 * is "impassible", due to either walls, or danger, as "ICKY", and
 * marking every grid which has been "checked" as "KNOW", allowing
 * us to only check the wall/danger status of any grid once.  This
 * provides some important optimization, since many "flows" can be
 * done before the "ICKY" and "KNOW" flags must be reset.
 *
 * Note that the "borg_enqueue_grid()" function should refuse to
 * enqueue "dangeous" destination grids, but does not need to set
 * the "KNOW" or "ICKY" flags, since having a "cost" field of zero
 * means that these grids will never be queued again.  In fact,
 * the "borg_enqueue_grid()" function can be used to enqueue grids
 * which are "walls", such as "doors" or "rubble".
 *
 * This function is extremely expensive, and is a major bottleneck
 * in the code, due more to internal processing than to the use of
 * the "borg_danger()" function, especially now that the use of the
 * "borg_danger()" function has been optimized several times.
 *
 * The "optimize" flag allows this function to stop as soon as it
 * finds any path which reaches the player, since in general we are
 * looking for paths to destination grids which the player can take,
 * and we can stop this function as soon as we find any usable path,
 * since it will always be as short a path as possible.
 *
 * We queue the "children" in reverse order, to allow any "diagonal"
 * neighbors to be processed first, since this may boost efficiency.
 *
 * Note that we should recalculate "danger", and reset all "flows"
 * if we notice that a wall has disappeared, and if one appears, we
 * must give it a maximal cost, and mark it as "icky", in case it
 * was currently included in any flow.
 *
 * If a "depth" is given, then the flow will only be spread to that
 * depth, note that the maximum legal value of "depth" is 250.
 *
 * "Avoid" flag means the borg will not move onto unknown grids,
 * nor to Monster grids if borg_desperate or borg_lunal_mode are
 * set.
 *
 * "Sneak" will have the borg avoid grids which are adjacent to a monster.

/*
 * Be "cautious" and attempt to prevent death or dishonor.

 * Strategy:
 *
 *   (1) Caution
 *   (1a) Analyze the situation
 *   (1a1) try to heal
 *   (1a2) try a defence
 *   (1b) Teleport from danger
 *   (1c) Handle critical stuff
 *   (1d) Retreat to happy grids
 *   (1e) Back away from danger
 *   (1f) Heal various conditions
 *
 *   (2) Attack
 *   (2a) Simulate possible attacks
 *   (2b) Perform optimal attack
 *
 *   (3) Recover
 *   (3a) Recover by spells/prayers
 *   (3b) Recover by items/etc
 *   (3c) Recover by resting
 *
 * XXX XXX XXX
 * In certain situations, the "proper" course of action is to simply
 * attack a nearby monster, since often most of the danger is due to
 * a single monster which can sometimes be killed in a single blow.
 *
 * Actually, both "borg_caution()" and "borg_recover()" need to
 * be more intelligent, and should probably take into account
 * such things as nearby monsters, and/or the relative advantage
 * of simply pummeling nearby monsters instead of recovering.
 *
 * Note that invisible/offscreen monsters contribute to the danger
 * of an extended "region" surrounding the observation, so we will
 * no longer rest near invisible monsters if they are dangerous.
 *
 * XXX XXX XXX
 * We should perhaps reduce the "fear" values of each region over
 * time, to take account of obsolete invisible monsters.
 *
 * Note that walking away from a fast monster is counter-productive,
 * since the monster will often just follow us, so we use a special
 * method which allows us to factor in the speed of the monster and
 * predict the state of the world after we move one step.  Of course,
 * walking away from a spell casting monster is even worse, since the
 * monster will just get to use the spell attack multiple times.  But,
 * if we are trying to get to known safety, then fleeing in such a way
 * might make sense.  Actually, this has been done too well, note that
 * it makes sense to flee some monsters, if they "stumble", or if we
 * are trying to get to stairs.  XXX XXX XXX
 *
 * Note that the "flow" routines attempt to avoid entering into
 * situations that are dangerous, but sometimes we do not see the
 * danger coming, and then we must attempt to survive by any means.
 *
 * We will attempt to "teleport" if the danger in the current situation,
 * as well as that resulting from attempting to "back away" from danger,
 * are sufficient to kill us in one or two blows.  This allows us to
 * avoid teleportation in situations where simply backing away is the
 * proper course of action, for example, when standing next to a nasty
 * stationary monster, but also to teleport when backing away will not
 * reduce the danger sufficiently.
 *
 * But note that in "nasty" situations (when we are running out of light,
 * or when we are starving, blind, confused, or hallucinating), we will
 * ignore the possibility of "backing away" from danger, when considering
 * the possibility of using "teleport" to escape.  But if the teleport
 * fails, we will still attempt to "retreat" or "back away" if possible.
 *
 * XXX XXX XXX Note that it should be possible to do some kind of nasty
 * "flow" algorithm which would use a priority queue, or some reasonably
 * efficient normal queue stuff, to determine the path which incurs the
 * smallest "cumulative danger", and minimizes the total path length.
 * It may even be sufficient to treat each step as having a cost equal
 * to the danger of the destination grid, plus one for the actual step.
 * This would allow the Borg to prefer a ten step path passing through
 * one grid with danger 10, to a five step path, where each step has
 * danger 9.  Currently, he often chooses paths of constant danger over
 * paths with small amounts of high danger.  However, the current method
 * is very fast, which is certainly a point in its favor...
 *
 * When in danger, attempt to "flee" by "teleport" or "recall", and if
 * this is not possible, attempt to "heal" damage, if needed, and else
 * attempt to "flee" by "running".
 *
 * XXX XXX XXX Both "borg_caution()" and "borg_recover()" should only
 * perform the HEALING tasks if they will cure more "damage"/"stuff"
 * than may be re-applied in the next turn, this should prevent using
 * wimpy healing spells next to dangerous monsters, and resting to regain
 * mana near a mana-drainer.
 *
 * Whenever we are in a situation in which, even when fully healed, we
 * could die in a single round, we set the "goal_fleeing" flag, and if
 * we could die in two rounds, we set the "goal_leaving" flag.
 *
 * In town, whenever we could die in two rounds if we were to stay still,
 * we set the "goal_leaving" flag.  In combination with the "retreat" and
 * the "back away" code, this should allow us to leave town before getting
 * into situations which might be fatal.
 *
 * Flag "goal_fleeing" means get off this level right now, using recall
 * if possible when we get a chance, and otherwise, take stairs, even if
 * it is very dangerous to do so.
 *
 * Flag "goal_leaving" means get off this level when possible, using
 * stairs if possible when we get a chance.
 *
 * We will also take stairs if we happen to be standing on them, and we
 * could die in two rounds.  This is often "safer" than teleportation,
 * and allows the "retreat" code to retreat towards stairs, knowing that
 * once there, we will leave the level.
 *
 * If we can, we should try to hit a monster with an offset  spell.
 * A Druj can not move but they are really dangerous.  So we should retreat
 * to a happy grid (meaning we have los and it does not), we should target
 * one space away from the bad guy then blast away with ball spells.
 *
 * Hack -- Special checks for dealing with Morgoth.
 * The borg would like to stay put on level 100 and use
 * spells to attack Morgoth then use Teleport Other as he
 * gets too close.
 * 1.  Make certain borg is sitting in a central room.
 * 2.  Attack Morgoth with spells.
 * 3.  Use Teleport Other on Morgoth as he approches.
 * 4.  Use Teleport Other/Mass Banishment on all other monsters
 *     if borg is correctly positioned in a good room.
 * 5.  Stay put and rest until Morgoth returns.

 * New method for handling attacks, missiles, and spells
 *
 * Every turn, we evaluate every known method of causing damage
 * to monsters, and evaluate the "reward" inherent in each of
 * the known methods which is usable at that time, and then
 * we actually use whichever method, if any, scores highest.
 *
 * For each attack, we need a function which will determine the best
 * possible result of using that attack, and return its value.  Also,
 * if requested, the function should actually perform the action.
 *
 * Note that the functions should return zero if the action is not
 * usable, or if the action is not useful.
 *
 * These functions need to apply some form of "cost" evaluation, to
 * prevent the use of expensive spells with minimal reward.  Also,
 * we should always prefer attacking by hand to using spells if the
 * damage difference is "small", since there is no "cost" in making
 * a physical attack.
 *
 * We should take account of "spell failure", as well as "missile
 * missing" and "blow missing" probabilities.
 *
 * Note that the functions may store local state information when
 * doing a "simulation" and then they can use this information if
 * they are asked to implement their strategy.
 *
 * There are several types of damage inducers:
 *
 *   Attacking physically
 *   Launching missiles
 *   Throwing objects
 *   Casting spells
 *   Praying prayers
 *   Using wands
 *   Using rods
 *   Using staffs
 *   Using scrolls
 *   Activating Artifacts
 *   Activate Dragon Armour
