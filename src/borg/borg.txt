# This file will allow you to customize your APWBorg along certain themes.
# The borg is fairly successful, having won the game several times.
# However, some players/observers of borgs would like to see it function
# differently.  Some would like to see the borg play more aggressively, or
# more conservatively.  While others would like to value armour class more.
# Still others would like to see it collect more speed items.

# With the expressions below, you can influence the borg's behavior and
# equipment selection choices.  The 'borg_worship_' variables will influence
# his equipment selection by adding additional bonuses to items which
# enhance that attribute.  For example:  if a borg recieves 2000 pts for
# a single point of armour class, an 'ac worshipping' borg would receive
# 3000 pts.  This bonus would significantly influence equipment choices.

# borg_worships_gold explained:
# The borg_worships_gold option will greatly impact how the borg treats items
# which he finds in the dungeon.  With this opion on, he will return to town
# whenever he fills up with items then sell those items.  This can cause
# the borg to lose some artifacts, since he will sell them even if not ID'd.
# Generally speaking the borg will not sell an item unless it is at least
# psuedo ID'd.  The benefit of this option is that the borg will significantly
# increase his income at the low clevels.  This will increase his survivablity
# by allowing him to invest in armour and arrows.  With this on,
# he will not recall to town to sell stuff but climb the stairs instead.
# He will also not recall into the dungeon until dlevel 8 (instead of 5).
# This option has no effect after clevel 20.  One other downside of this is
# that the borg will spend more time in town and may have to evade Vets more.


# To modify, simply set it to TRUE or FALSE.

# NOTE: THERE MUST BE A SPACE AFTER THE =
# option = TRUE   is acceptable
# option =TRUE    is NOT acceptable and will result in a default value.

# Risky

# A risky borg is one who is not confined by character level requirements
# in order to dive deeper.  It is also more likely to stay in a battle than
# to teleport out.  A risky borg will dive faster but is more likely to die.
# A risky borg is not concerned with killing uniques before diving deeper.
#
# A borg who scums for uniques will set the auto_scum flag in order to generate
# more exciting levels and hopefully encounter a unique
# 
# borgs who kill_uniques will wait for uniques to die before diving deeper
# into the dungeon.  Usually, he will not dive deeper then three uniques.  
# Example, Unique Monsters who normally reside on levels 12, 15, and 18 are 
# still alive so the borg will not dive deeper than level 18 until at least one
# of those uniques are dead.  Setting this to FALSE will allow the borg to dive
# deeper, faster, not being held up by the uniques.  But, he does run the risk
# of finding 3 or 4 uniques on one level.  That can be a bit scary.

borg_plays_risky = FALSE

borg_kills_uniques = FALSE


# Swap Items

# The borg is designed to use Swap Items in the inventory.  A swap item
# is an equipment item (like a sword or armour item) which posseses a
# desireable resistance or trait.  If the borg is in danger, then he will
# consider exchanging his current item for the swap item.  A prime example of
# this is at dungeon level 60.  He is required to have several resists in
# place.  If he does not have them then he will not dive deeper.  However,
# with Swaps enabled he will select an item to cover the open resist then
# dive down.  Having Swaps enabled allows the borg to dive deeper, faster.
# The draw back is the Swap Items take up two inventory slots.

borg_uses_swaps = TRUE



# Home Storage

# The borg has two routines to store items in the home.  One is very
# effective and will make the best possible choice for adding an item to the
# home.  Unfortunately, this function is very slow.  A much faster routine
# will do a fine job at storing items in the home but it is not as
# efficient.

borg_slow_optimizehome = FALSE


# Respawn

# If the borg is in continual play mode (as with the screen saver),
# he will respawn a randomly generated character at death.  This section
# allows the user to make certain bias for the type of character generated.
# You may select the race and or class and or minimal stats for the Borg.
# You may also select the minimal character level needed before the
# character dump is created in the game directory.

# With regards to race, the borg is programmed to accept the variety of
# user defined races which may be in the p_info.txt file.  So the values
# given in table below are for the default races.  But if you are bright
# enough to modify the p_info.txt file then you are bright enough to figure
# out that race 0 does not necessarily equal Human.  It's just the first
# race listed in your p_info.txt file.
#
# RACE:-1 Random Race          CLASS:  -1 Random Class
#       0 Human                         0 Warrior
#       1 Half Elf                      1 Mage
#       2 Elf                           2 Priest
#       3 Hobbit                        3 Rogue
#       4 Gnome                         4 Ranger
#       5 Dwarf                         5 Paladin
#       6 Half Orc
#       7 Half Troll
#       8 Dunadan
#       9 High Elf
#	   10 Kobold
#
# With regards to the stats.  The minimal stats are rolled by the
# borg.  CON will be 16, the secondary stat (usually DEX) will be 17,
# The primary stat will be 17.  These are the maximal values which
# can be rolled (racial and class bonuses added after).
# If the borg can not reach the stats after 500,000 tries the game
# will just assign you a random stat.
#
# After killing Morgoth, generally, the borg will stop and allow you
# to inspect the victory.  If you set the respawn_winners then after
# killing Morgoth,the borg will generate a new character.  A map file
# is created so you can see what the final battle looked like.

borg_respawn_race = -1
borg_respawn_class = -1
borg_respawn_winners = FALSE


# Dumps

# This variable will determine the minimal character level at which the borg
# will create a character dump file.  That file contains some vital information
# concerning the status of the borg at the time of his demise.  It is placed
# in the user directory.
# The borg_save_death variable will tell the borg to save the game in the user
# directory so that it can be examined more closely.  The clevel of the borg
# must at least equal the borg_dump_level in order for the game to save.

borg_dump_level = 1
borg_save_death = 1

# Auto Stops

# The borg is able to stop when it reaches a certain dungeon depth or character
# level.  He will also stop when he wins the game.  If you want him to keep
# playing, even after Morgoth is dead, then change the borg_stop_king to FALSE.
# Set the other values to the level at which you want the borg to stop.  Set
# them out of bounds if you do not want him to stop.

borg_stop_dlevel = 128
borg_stop_clevel = 51
borg_no_deeper = 127
borg_stop_king = FALSE


# Chest Tolerance

# The borg is able to search, disarm, and open chests.  There is a inherant
# risk when dealing with chests.  The risk of setting off the trap vs the
# benefit of the loot within the chest.  The game uses a straight forward 
# formula for calculating the success of a chest.  It is:
# randint(100) < the skill of the player minus the dificulty of the chest.
# Difficulties run from 1 to 63.  I would recommend a tolerance of about 7
# for vanilla chests (since they suck) and about 15 for DrAngband.

borg_chest_fail_tolerance = 7


# Speed of the Borg

# You can slow the borg down several different ways.  One way is to set the
# base game delay factor in the options menu.  This will slow down the borg
# and the visual effects (like missiles shooting, explosions).  If using the
# screensaver, you will need to load angband.exe load the savefile, make the
# modifications, then save and exit.  Another way to slow the borg down is
# to add more term windows.  The more it has to do, the slower it will be.
# I recommend using Inventory, Equipment, Messages, Monster Recall, Borg
# Status windows. Then you can really see what the borg is up to.  Lastly,
# to slow the borg down use the following variable.  The formula is:
# base_game_delay_factor^2 + borg_delay_factor^2.

borg_delay_factor = 6


# Money Scumming

# This started as more of a joke but it does have a useful purpose.  If you 
# find yourself shopping in the BM and you really want that item and its just 
# out of your price range, then you can set a dollar amount into this variable 
# and the borg will run around town killing monsters and collecting items for 
# cash.  Once he has reached his monetary goal, it will unhook and stop moving.  
# The borg will wait on the level, to build up more towns people, kill them, 
# buy food when it needs to.  But it won't leave the level until the goal
# is reached.  To disengage the money scum, leave this variable at 0 (zero).
# This will also simulate the borg_worships_gold and allow the borg to sell 
# non-ID'd items which will be dropped in town.  The borg will flee from town 
# from Scary Guys.  So keep this in mind with borgs under clevel 6. The borg 
# will not scum unless he has a perma light source (phial, or some glowing 
# artifact). The borg will stop if the General Store runs out of food to buy.
# It is not recommended for borgs with Regeneration and no Slow 
# Digestion, since they will spend all their money on food.  But if you have a
# borg with Satisfy Hunger spell, they can stay in town forever.
# NOTE: if a human wants the borg to scum to a particular amount, turn the 
# borg_self_scum to FALSE or else he will buy his own gear with that money.

borg_money_scum_amount = 0


# Borg Scumming

# This is a companion to the Money Scum above.  The borg will scum town if
# a stat potion is in the BM.  If the borg finds an item in town that he would
# really like to have, then he will stay in town until he can gathered enough
# money to buy it.  The borg will behave like the borg_money_scum_amount above.
# If this is TRUE, then the borg is allowed to scum for items that he wants.
# To forbid this behavior (which can take a very long time) set it FALSE.
# NOTE: if a human wants the borg to scum to a particular amount, turn the 
# borg_self_scum to FALSE or else he will buy his own gear with that money.
# Also, the borg must be at least clevel 10, with a perma light, 
# a 65% chance to avoid the pick pocket, and lots of food.

borg_self_scum = TRUE


# Lunal Borg

# The borg will dive deep in the dungeon, even while he is still
# low level, bouncing between levels to take nearby down stairs.
# Once deep, he will gather items, then recall to town.  He will not recall
# back down into the dungeon, but walk all the way down again.  If you want
# a fast win, this is not the option for you.  If you want the borg to have
# maxed stats early on at the expense of game turns, then give this a try.
# The best way to use this is to have a borg that can cast Satisfy Hunger.
# This is a one way trip for the borg and he will be getting hungry.
# The borg should also have a perma light source (like the phial).  Again,
# one way trip.  He won't be stopping to restock his fuel source.  However,
# if he has food or fuel, he will use them when appropriate.  Having extra
# speed will help the borg too.  Often he will come down the stairs, and 
# find himself right next to a monster.  Sometimes, that monster can get
# the first hit on a borg, killing him instantly.  Even +3 speed would help
# to avoid this type of instadeath.
#
# Self Lunal Mode will allow the borg to use the stair scumming in order to
# dive deep in the dungeon for his own goals.  For example, if the borg has
# been down to depth 99, and now has no more potions of healing, he will
# only be prepared for depth 45.  He will remain shallow in the dungeon,
# from depth 1-10 waiting for the shops to cycle.  Then he will attempt to 
# buy a healing potion from the town shops.  If none is available, he will
# return to the shallow dungeon depths and wait for the shops to cycle.  He 
# will repeat this pattern until he gets a potion of healing.  If the borg 
# is allowed to self-lunal, then it will bounce the stairs down to a depth
# where it feels comfortable.  In the case above, it will do this until
# about depth 40.

borg_lunal_mode = FALSE
borg_self_lunal = FALSE


# Borg Verbose

# Verbose is default off.  It makes the borg give more reports on his actions
# and thoughts.  He still gives reports when verbose is FALSE, but when TRUE, 
# he really chats up a storm.

borg_verbose = FALSE



# Munchkin Start

# Munchink start will have the borg stair-scum at depth <borg_munchkin_depth>, looking for items
# which he will then sell in town.  He will continue this process until about
# clevel <borg_munchkin_level>.  The advantage is a sizable boost to his early income and
# he can find some wands early on to assist with monster killing.

borg_munchkin_start = TRUE
borg_munchkin_level = 20
borg_munchkin_depth = 15

# Enchant Limit

# The borg knows how to enchant his equipment using scrolls and spells.
# For ammo, he will stop enchanting about +10 or so.  If he has access 
# to the *enchant* spell, he can go up to +15.  But the borg will spend
# a lot of time casting and resting in order to get his item up to +15.
# The borg has plenty of time, to waste doing this.  If you want a fast
# win, then choose a lower number like +11.

borg_enchant_limit = 12


# WARNING: If you mess with the objects.txt or the monster.txt and change 
# the locations of things, then you must make those changes in borg.txt
# as well as in this borg code.  The borg is very concerned about item 
# index locations.  ie: borgs_has[242] is looking for a Potion of Healing.
# The borg is concerned over several items, broken swords, and several 
# monster locations (Tarresque, Sauron, Morgoth).

# use the POWER_ and REQ_ lines below.  If false the borg will
# use the calcs in the C code.  Which is recommended since I hone those
# more frequently than I do the dynamic calcs.  Most borg users will 
# have more successful borgs by leaving this option as FALSE.
# note: the dynamic calcs are slower than the internal calcs

borg_uses_dynamic_calcs = FALSE


# CHANGE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Changes here can cause VERY STUPID borg
# behaviour.  If you do change them and your borg acts goofy, do not email me
