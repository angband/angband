# Background
This version includes changes to device activation, many corrections and
improvements to the borg automatic player, and several bug fixes. Changes
affecting gameplay are:

* Like digging, failure to activate a magical device automatically retries the
  activation until successful or disturbed. Make utility devices, elemental
  rings, and dragon armor easier to activate. Devices to slow monsters, wands
  of fire balls and dragon's flame, rods of fire bolts, and rods of treasure
  location are now more difficult to activate. Change the activation
  difficulties for artifacts so they are better aligned with the nature of the
  activation. Change a constant in the failure rate calculation to tighten the
  transition from high to low failure rates: effects that change a player's
  device skill will have more of an impact if the skill is close to the
  activation difficulty for the device.
* When following a precomputed path (moving to a grid designated by the mouse,
  targeting interface, or autoexplore commands) automatically open doors or
  clear impassable rubble and continue moving when the neighbors of the door
  or rubble are known.
* Object descriptions now include the effect of curses in the displayed hit,
  damage, and armor class values.
* Messages for detection now distinguish between gold on the floor and other
  objects (thanks to PowerDiver).
* Objects and spells that used SPOT effects with LIGHT_WEAK or DARK_WEAK now
  use SPHERE instead so they can not damage the player.
* Change the target handling for a druid's Lightning Strike: do not require a
  known grid and target the player if the target is given as a direction or is
  not a passable grid in the line of sight.
* If a necromancer's Command spell is resisted, deduct mana and take a turn
  (thanks to RegalStar).
* Mithril arrows and shots weigh 50% less; mithril shots ignore acid and fire
  (thanks to edz314).
* Increase the curse removal power of staves of remove curse to distinguish
  them from scrolls of remove curse (thanks to Mitze).
* Increase the escorts for Grishnákh and Golfimbul: both can also have cave
  orcs as escorts.
* Change the edges of the Cracks of Doom vault so magic mapping clearly
  identifies the entrances (thanks to Mikolaj).
* Change handling of keymaps so the keymap aborts when the next key does not
  correspond to a command, a command fails due to a missing prerequisite or to
  a player confirmation from an inscription check. Rework how directions are
  extracted from a keymap. Allow for a keymap trigger whose action starts with
  ESCAPE to break out of many prompts (thanks to PowerWyrm).
* Add an option, autoexplore_commands, to have 'p' move to the player to the
  nearest unexplored location and modify the existing '>' and '<' commands to
  move the player to the nearest staircase of the appropriate type when not on
  a staircase (thanks to memmaker). Whether or not that option is set, add to
  the looking or targeting interface so '>' or '<' move the cursor to the
  nearest appropriate staircase from where the cursor was and 'x' moves the
  cursor to the nearest unexplored location to where the cursor was (thanks
  to Gwarl).
* The notifications shown when the show_damage option is on now include
  information about damage due to effects from spells or magic devices.
  Notifications about damage to the player now take into account damage
  reduction and invulnerability.

There are a handful of notable changes to the Windows front end (thanks to
Klaas van Aarsen):

* With tiles, the map displayed by 'M' now uses the algorithm that
  Options->Map used. Options->Map has been removed.
* Subwindows can have more than 256 rows or columns without drawing artifacts.

The handling of the SDL2 frontend's menus has been rewritten. Game controller
events are now mapped to keystrokes to invoke commands in the game (thanks to
Alberto Mardegan).

The changes for the borg automatic player are too numerous to list
individually. They correct many crashes, instances where manual intervention
was needed to allow the borg to make progress, jumping into lava, or cases
where the borg misused a spell (thanks to Adam Goodman, Aodhlin,
Jordan Philyaw, and NetBrian).

There is one change that can break compatibility with a game in progress or
prevent reuse of a randart file from earlier versions of 4.2: the misnamed
FIRE_BOLT72 activation is now FIRE_BALL72. If a game in progress uses randarts
and an artifact has that activation, the randart file will fail to load. A
workaround is to edit the randart file and replace FIRE_BOLT72 with FIRE_BALL72.

Prebuilt binaries for NDS and 3ds are no longer available. Patches to restore
building Angband for those systems are welcome.
