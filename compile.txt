Compiling Angband 2.9.0
=======================

Last updated on 2nd April 2000 by Robert Ruehlmann


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick and dirty compilation instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For many platforms (including Windows and DOS), a "pre-compiled" archive
is available, which contains everything you need to install and play
Angband.  For other platforms, including most UNIX systems, you must
compile the source code yourself.  Try the following non-trivial steps:

Step 1: Acquire.  Ftp to "export.andrew.cmu.edu:/angband/Source"
                  Try "bin" and "mget angband*.tar.gz" and "y"
Step 2: Extract.  Try "gunzip *.gz" then "tar -xvf *.tar"
Step 3: Prepare.  Try "cd angband*/src", then edit "Makefile"
                  You may also edit "h-config.h" and "config.h"
Step 4: Compile.  Try "make", and then "cd .." if successful
Step 5: Execute.  Try "angband -uTest" to initialize stuff

Step 6: Play....  Read the "online help" via the "?" command.

Of course, if you have a compiler, you can compile a (possibly customized)
executable on almost any system.  You will need the "source archive" (as
above), which contains the standard "src" and "lib" directories, and for
some platforms (including Macintosh and Windows), you will also need an
appropriate "extra archive", which contains some extra platform specific
files, and instructions about how to use them.  Some "extra archives" may
be found at the ftp site (including "/angband/Macintosh/ext-mac.sit.bin"
and "/angband/Windows/ext-win.zip"), but be sure that you get a version
of the "extra archive" designed for Angband 2.9.0.

DOS + DJGPP
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(written by Robert Ruehlmann < rr9@angband.org >)

- Install DJGPP:
	You can get the freely available DJGPP C Compiler from
	< http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/ >.  On the DJGPP-page go to the
	Zip-Picker < http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/zip-picker.html >.
	This page helps you decide which ZIP files you need to download
	and will even try to find a ftp-site near you.  The only thing you
	need to change on this page is under 'Extra Stuff/Toolkits'.
	Select the Allegro-library < http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/ >
	if you want graphics and sound support.  Get all files suggested and
	follow the installation instructions.
- Install the Angband source:
	Get the source code archive and the untgz tool from:
	"ftp://export.andrew.cmu.edu/angband/Tool/untgz.exe" or
	"ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/games/Angband/Tool/untgz.exe".
	Then extract the source with untgz ("untgz angban~1.tgz").
- Install other required files:
	Get the "extra archive" from
	< ftp://export.andrew.cmu.edu/angband/DOS-386/ext-dos.zip > or
	< ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/games/Angband/DOS-386/ext-dos.zip >.
	Go to the angband-290 directory and unzip the ext-dos archive into it.
	Then get the graphics archive from
	< ftp://export.andrew.cmu.edu/angband/Extra/angband-290-graf.zip > or
	< ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/games/Angband/Extra/angband-290-graf.zip >
	and unzip it into the lib/xtra/graf/ folder.
- Select the makefile:
	Go to the src-directory and rename 'makefile.dos' (or 'makefile.ibm'
	if you don't want graphics and sound and didn't download the Allegro
	library) to 'makefile'.
- Compile Angband:
	Run "make install".  Angband should now be compiled and installed
	into the Angband folder.
- Run Angband:
	Go back to the Angband folder and run Angband.exe.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows 95/98/NT/2000 + MS Visual C++ 5.0/6.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(written by Robert Ruehlmann < rr9@angband.org >)

- Install the Angband source:
	Get the source code and the untgz tool from:
	"ftp://export.andrew.cmu.edu/angband/Tool/untgz32.exe" or
	"ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/games/Angband/Tool/untgz32.exe".
	Then extract the source with "untgz32 angband-290-src.tgz".
- Install other required files:
	Get the "extra archive" from
	< ftp://export.andrew.cmu.edu/angband/Windows/ext-win.zip > or
	< ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/games/Angband/Windows/ext-win.zip >.
	Go to the angband-290 directory and unzip the ext-win archive into it.
	Again make sure the directory structure is preserved (use the -d
	option in pkunzip).
	Then get the graphics archive from
	< ftp://export.andrew.cmu.edu/angband/Extra/angband-290-graf.zip > or
	< ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/games/Angband/Extra/angband-290-graf.zip >
	and unzip it into the lib/xtra/graf/ folder.
- Open the project-file:
	Go to the src-folder and open the file "Angband.dsw".  That opens
	Visual C++ already properly configured for compiling Angband.
- Compile Angband:
	Select "Build Angband.exe" in the Build menu.  Angband should now
	be compiled and the Angband.exe will be placed into the "angband-290"
	directory.
- Run Angband:
	Go back to the Angband-folder and run the Angband.exe.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows 95/98/NT/2000 + Borland C++ 5.5 commandline tools
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(written by Robert Ruehlmann < rr9@angband.org >)

- Getting the free commandline tools:
	Download the Borland commandline tools from
	http://www.borland.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/
	and follow the installation instructions.
- Install the Angband source:
	Get the source code and  the untgz tool from:
	"ftp://export.andrew.cmu.edu/angband/Tool/untgz32.exe" or
	"ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/games/Angband/Tool/untgz32.exe".
	Then extract the source with "untgz32 angband-290-src.tgz".
- Install other required files:
	Get the "extra archive" from
	< ftp://export.andrew.cmu.edu/angband/Windows/ext-win.zip > or
	< ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/games/Angband/Windows/ext-win.zip >.
	Go to the angband-290 directory and unzip the ext-win archive into it.
	Again make sure the directory structure is preserved (use the -d
	option in pkunzip).
	Then get the graphics archive from
	< ftp://export.andrew.cmu.edu/angband/Extra/angband-290-graf.zip > or
	< ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/games/Angband/Extra/angband-290-graf.zip >
	and unzip it into the lib/xtra/graf/ folder.
- Compile Angband:
	Open a commandline window and go to the src-directory.  Run
	"make -f makefile.bcc install".  Angband should now be compiled
	and installed into the Angband folder.
- Run Angband:
	Go back to the Angband-folder and run the Angband.exe.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux + GCC
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(written by Robert Ruehlmann < rr9@angband.org >)

- Install the Angband source:
	Extract the source code with "tar -xvzf angband-290-src.tgz".
- Install the graphics files:
	If you want to use graphics under X11 then get the archive from
	< ftp://export.andrew.cmu.edu/angband/Extra/angband-290-graf.zip > or
	< ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/games/Angband/Extra/angband-290-graf.zip >
	and unzip it into the lib/xtra/graf/ folder.
- Prepare the makefile:
	Go to the angband-290/src directory, rename makefile.std to
	makefile.  The makefile is already configured properly to compile
	a version with support for both console (using ncurses) and X11.
	If this configuration doesn't work for you then you might have to
	open the makefile with your favorite text-editor and select one
	of the other variations for Linux.
- Compiling Angband:
	Run "make install".  Angband should now be compiled and installed
	into the "angband-290" folder.  Go back to the angband-290
	directory.
- Setting the proper access rights for a single user:
	If you don't have root-access to the machine, or just want to
	set up the game for multiple users then you just have to make
	angband executable with "chmod u+x angband".
	You can skip the next step.
- Setting the proper access rights for multiple users:
	To allow proper use of Angband on a Linux system with multiple
	users, you must make the angband executable owned and setuid to
	games.  Note that you need root-access to change the ownership of
	files.  Use "chown games angband" and "chmod +xs angband".
 	This makes the game executable for everyone, while turning on the
 	"suid bit". That bit makes the game run as if it were user "games",
 	so that the game has write access to savefiles and so on, but normal
 	users don't.  Then use "chown -R games lib" to make all files in the
 	lib-folder owned by the user games so that Angband can write
 	savefiles, scores, and other files.
- Run Angband:
	"./angband" should start Angband.
