  * New upstream release. Angband 3.1.x is a development series which
    contains a number of major changes - see changes.txt for details.
  * This package is now entirely GPL compliant - moved to main.
                                                        Closes:  #511368

angband (1:3.0.9b-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * pre-inst fails on upgrade from version 1:3.0.5-1, as we are not
    checking /var/lib/games/angband/save has any files in it - if it
    doesn't, then you see the failure mode described. Analysis and fix
    from Matthew Vernon. This closes an important bug.  Closes:  #494199
  * /var/games/angband/data/spell.raw has wrong permissions. We set the
    correct permission on 4 other directories in the /var/games/angband/
    hierarchy, and really, this chmod g+w was a long standing bug. While
    not labeled important, this is a minimal change, and is consistent
    with the handling of other game files. Thanks to Chris Carr.
                                                        Closes: #490871
  * Updated Standards-Version. No changes.

angband (1:3.0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. This is a fairly major update, and should work
    better than the older versions.                       Closes: #437001

angband (1:3.0.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ack NMU.
  * Updated copyright files.
  * Bug fix: "angband: Upgrade woody-&gt;sarge has lost high-score file",
    thanks to Matthew Vernon. Now try to recover from the

    clear out the obsolete cruft on install.             (Closes: #370223).
  * Bug fix: "diff for 1:3.0.6-2.1 NMU", thanks to Steinar H. Gunderson
    Applied.                                             (Closes: #372653).

angband (1:3.0.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated build dependencies
  * Bug fix: "failure to purge", thanks to Sebastian Rittau. Make sure we
    get rid of all the add-on info files as well.            (Closes: #345593).

angband (1:3.0.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - Wands and staves are no longer destroyed when a recharge attempt
       backfires.  Instead all the charges are drained.
     - Renamed the artifact short sword 'Gilettar' to 'Dagmor' since that
       name is mentioned for the sword of Beren in Tolkien's notes.
       (suggested by Tyler Witter)
     - Added a new type of subwindow for displaying the dungeon area around
       the player.
     - Added a new subwindow type "Display player (compact)" that displays
       the left-hand-side of the main term (player stats, hitpoints, gold,
       ...) in a separate window.
     - Added a new window type that displays the info from the status line.
     - Turned the "scroll map while targetting" option permanently on.
     - Added a display of the temporary resists to the status line.  The
       resists are only displayed if there is enough room after the dungeon
       level (when using a main or status term with at least 85 cols).
       The verbosity of the output (between "Acid Elec Fire Cold Pois" and
       "AEFCP") depends on the term width.
     - Display the player's speed in the character dump and on the info page.
     - Identified scrolls can now look different from unidentified ones.
       This allows the use of the individual scroll tiles created by David
       Gervais.
     - Allow the ammo-branding activation of 'Cubragol' to be aborted without
       using up the charge. (Diego Gonzalez and Jeff Greene)
     - Use actual monster and object symbols instead of a list of hardcoded
       symbols when hallucinating.
     - Added Craig Oliver's Sound FX Patch version 1.1 that adds about 120
       new sound events to the game.
       (see also http://www.chambrook.org/angband/soundfx.php)
     - Scroll the map when the player is 1/4th of the visible grids away from
       the edge of the map display.
     - Allow the OS X version to be started from a read-only medium, for
       example from a disk image or a central installation under
       'Applications'.  All user-specific files like savefiles, scores,
       char-dumps, and saved preferences are stored in
       'Library/Preferences/Angband/' and its subfolders inside the user's
       home directory.
     - The Mac OS X application bundle now includes all the necessary files
       from the lib folder.  The separate lib folder in the distribution is
       no longer necessary.  This means that the OS X version can now be
       installed by simply dragging the application icon to the target
       directory.
     - The OS X version would crash when changing the sound or graphics
       options before a character was created or loaded. (reported by Patrick
       Hughes)
     - Don't save the Mac OS X preferences on exit if the game hasn't been
       initialized properly to prevent corruption of the preference file in
       case of an error at startup.  Skip loading the preference file if it
       is broken. (problem reported by Matt Stone)
     - Include the basic Angband sound files per default in the OS X version.
     - Made the tile size independent of the font size in the X11 version.
       Store various window settings like the window size between sessions.
     - Don't add a hardcoded 'games' subdirectory to the installation path on
       multi-user machines.
     - Allow all user created files to be saved in subdirectories under
       ~/.angband/Angband/ when PRIVATE_USER_PATH is defined.
     - Allow the use of the 'vcs' display module on systems with devfs-style
       '/dev/vc/*' terminals.
     - The virtual console (vcs) front-end does now implement cursor
       visibility and bigscreen support.  (Alexander Ulyanov)
     - Enable cursor visibility in the "gcu" front-end on Linux systems.
       (Alexander Ulyanov)
     - Fixed a bug in the Xaw frontend, which made Angband crash if the main
       window geometry was specified as an X resource. (Alexander Ulyanov)
     - Make X11 frontends show floors as centered dots, walls as blocks, and
       treasures as diamonds. (Alexander Ulyanov)
     - Removed the restriction of bigtile mode to the main window in the X11
       version.
     - Added Alexander Ulyanov's Linux framebuffer display module from:
       http://posband.earthsea.org/misc/angband-lfb-20050220.tar.gz
     - Added compile instructions for MinGW/MSYS on Windows. (Tuomas
       Härkönen)
     - Added compile instructions for gcc on Mac OS X.
     - Fixed a stupid bug that could cause the game to hang or crash when
       killing quest monsters near the edge of the dungeon. (Ivan Tuckwell
       and Dr. Andrew White)
     - Added missing tiles and tile assignments for the 32x32 tiles. (Ivan
       Jekic and David Gervais)
     - The charges of rods of perception weren't handled correctly when
       compiling with scripting turned off. (reported by "Twilight" and Jeff
       Greene)
     - Cursed speed rings should not increase the level feeling. (Anssi
       Ramela and Jeff Greene)
     - Refresh the list of visible monsters after (Mass) Banishment,
       Earthquake, and Destruction spells, when using the 'delete nearby
       monsters' function in debug mode, as well as when pressing Ctrl-R.
       ("Twilight")
     - Don't try to write zero-length blocks when saving the lib/data/*.raw
       files. (suggested by Juha Niemimaki)
     - Corrected the item description for scrolls of recharging. (reported by
       Hugo Kornelis)
     - Fixed a Angband 3.0.6 alpha 1 specific crash with the Mac OS X 10.4
       (Tiger) caused by releasing a reference that should not be released.
       (reported by Harry Erwin)
     - The experience loss as a result of one of the One Ring's activations
       is now 1/4 of both max and current experience instead of the
       unintended reduction of max exp by 3/16 of the current experience.
       (Hugo Kornelis)
     - Cleaned up the handling of experience draining when the player has
       Hold Life. The fixed part of the exp drain by nether breaths is now
       also reduced by Hold Life. (Hugo Kornelis)
     - The 'star ball' activation fired one ball more when scripting was
       enabled.  (Hugo Kornelis)
     - The object description for the 'cure wounds' activation reads
       "activates for cure wounds (4d7)", but it actually cures 4d8 points of
       damage.  The description has been fixed. (Hugo Kornelis)
     - The "recharge item" artifact activation can now be canceled at the
       "Recharge which item" prompt without draining the artifact's charge.
       (Hugo Kornelis)
     - The symbol for the Shield of Deflection was a light blue [ instead of
       a ) like all other shields. (Hugo Kornelis)
     - Reduced the price for "Raal's Tome of Destruction". (Hugo Kornelis and
       Timo Pietila)

angband (1:3.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  *  Bug fix: "angband: incomplete copyright file", thanks to Andrew
    Saunders. The copyright file was actually created by Joshua Kwon, who
    apparently has uploaded angband as an NMU, but I have not seen it on
    my mirror yet. In any case, the NMU was appreciated. Thanks for the
    help.                                                 (Closes: #248668).
  * New upstream release.
    - Summoned creatures appear near the caster now instead of near the
      player.
    - Made rods of detection invulnerable to electric attacks.
    - Restored the old behavior of the Glyph of Warding to protect against
      direct melee attacks when standing on it.
    - Rods can no longer be drained by monsters.
    - The minor vault "Interlock" had switched height and width definitions,
      causing it to be created in a chaotic state. (Werner Baer)
    - Spells that prompt the user for an item (identify, enchantment,
      recharging) or an monster letter (banishment) no longer use mana if
      canceled.
    - The order of mage spells in the books in the non-Lua version is now
      the same as in the Lua version.
    - Give energy to monsters and the player at the end of the game turn
      instead of at the start.  This prevents various odd effects when
      loading a saved game. (reported by Phil)
    - The activation descriptions for rings were missing with Lua scripting
      turned off. (Jeff Greene)
    - The SHATTER (earthquake) attack of monsters can cause the player to be
      pushed into another position.  Processing of the remaining blows of
      the monster should stop in that case. Otherwise the player could get
      hit "through a wall" that was created by the earthquake. (Jeff Greene)
    - Removed the autoroller delay.
    - Cleaned up the paragraph handling in the object descriptions.
      (Hallvard B Furuseth)
    - "It cannot be harmed by acid and fire" should be "... acid *or* fire".
      (Hallvard B Furuseth)
    - Piles of wands, staves, and rods can be used from the ground without
      picking them up first.
    - Fixed a problem in the Unix/Linux makefiles.  The POSIX standard
      doesn't allow a dot instead of a colon as separator for the chown
      parameters.
    - Removed an accidental use of floating point code that prevented
      Angband from running on old machines without an FPU.
    - Removed unnecessary event handlers that negativly affected performance.
    - The "pseudo graphics" used by the (n)curses version didn't support
      terrain lightning correctly.
    - The window resize control was sometimes overwritten with a black tile
      in the OS X version.
    - Removed the warning message about missing preferences from the OS X
      version.  The first thing a new player sees after starting Angband
      shouldn't be a "scary" message.
    - Added a Windows helpfile created by Jordan Hobbs.
    - Added project files for building Angband with MS Visual C++ 7.1.
      (Tasha Jessup)

angband (1:3.0.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "-mgcu is gone, no more angband on the console...", thanks to
    Jurriaan. Added libncurses5-dev to the build-depends line, since
    building on a buildd or a pbuilder environment mace gcu disappear
                                                         (Closes: #244178).

angband (1:3.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Made the water vortex immune to water-based attacks.
    - Chaos resistance protects against confusion by chaos based attacks.
    - Smoothed out the tables for extra mana-points per level, hitpoint
      bonus from constitution, "spells per level" vs. "spell stat", and
      INT/WIS dependent failure rate adjustment.  The old steps have been
      replaced by a steady increase, so small stat improvements are more
      useful.  Please note that this will also affect characters imported
      from older versions, so these might gain or lose some spells, mana,
      and hitpoints when imported into Angband 3.0.4.
    - Gave the 'thanc daggers a 2d4 damage dice instead of 1d4 and made them
      more common. (Jonathan Ellis)
    - Gave each of the Paur* gauntlets a single minor power (slow-digestion,
      regeneration, permanent light, feather fall) and made them more
      common. (Jonathan Ellis)
    - Rods, wands, and staves with different charges can now be stacked.
      (based on the NPPAngband version that in turn is based on
      Leon Marrick's rod/wand stacking in OAngband.
    - Rods can't be recharged anymore, but can be vulnerable to electricity.
    - Rods of Recall, Perception, Curing, Healing, Restoration, and Speed
      will not be destroyed by electricity.
    - Made Raal's Tome of Destruction more, and Kelek's Grimoire of Power
      less common. (Timo Pietilä)
    - Heavy crossbows no longer can get the 'of the Haradrim' suffix and
      'light crossbows of the Haradrim' get a smaller damage bonus. (Timo
      Pietilä)
    - Removed fire brand from ammo 'of Holy Might'. (Timo Pietilä)
    - Give the short range teleport effect from gravity attacks on monsters
      an additional 1 in 3 chance to teleport the monster away.  This should
      make abusing the Rift spell a bit harder.
    - Added a level dependent chance to resist the teleportation effect of
      gravity attacks for monsters and the player. (suggested by Jonathan
      Ellis)
    - Junk items like broken sticks, empty bottles, and rodent skeletons are
      no longer generated in the dungeon.
    - Removed the old haggling code.  The auto-haggling code is now
      permanently active and will give the normal price of items without the
      10% "sales tax".
    - Replaced the old screendump code with HTML screendump code that
      handles graphics, bigscreen, bigtile, and other display oddities much
      better. (based on the htmldump-patch by Darkgod).
    - Added support for artifact and ego-item descriptions. (with help from
      Hallvard B Furuseth)
    - Added artifact descriptions.  The texts are mainly taken from OAngband
      and other variants. (Jonathan Ellis)
    - Added object descriptions assembled by Hallvard B Furuseth.  The
      descriptions are mostly copied from obj-long.spo version 3.0.2 by Hugo
      Kornelis, Stephen S. Lee, Leonard Dickens and Craig Lewis.
    - Added ego item descriptions for some ego types. (Hallvard B Furuseth)
    - "Easy open" ignores broken doors now when trying to close doors.
    - Added the equipment flag matrix to the character dump.
    - Added new 8x8 tiles and tile definitions provided by "Dawnmist".
    - Added the player's maximum depth in the dungeon to the character
      display and the dump.
    - Removed several broken tile definitions for the 32x32 tiles.
    - Use the proper monster flags instead of workarounds for various
      resists and immunities.  This also allows the reporting of these flags
      in the monster recall and the spoilers. (pointed out by Leon Marrick)
    - You can now use either 'm' or 'p' to cast spells or pray.
    - Allow direct melee attacks on visible monsters in walls.  You still
      have to tunnel into the wall if you are trying to attack an invisible
      monster. (suggested by Greg Stark)
    - Show infos like "It cannot be harmed by the elements." when
      'Inspecting' books, just as for other item types.
    - Changed the behavior of the 'auto_more' option, so that it
      automatically skips '-more-' prompts instead of not displaying
      messages on the top line. (Tom Houser)
    - Changed the "Do you really want to quit?" prompt to "Do you really
      want to commit suicide?".
    - Added a 'show scores' command to the knowledge menu.
    - Changed the wording for the scores display a bit.
    - Added the kill count of non-unique monsters to the knowledge menu.
    - Added a modified version of Mogami's macro trigger patch. This patch
      modifies how macro trigger keys are displayed on screen and written in
      .prf files.  The trigger keys are no longer displayed in ugly key code
      style, such like ^__FFBE\r or ^_O_FF53\r, but in more smart style,
      such like \[F1] or \[alt-Right].
    - Added a better character selection screen with support for using the
      cursor keys, display of info about the various race and class choices,
      and context sensitive help.  The code is based on the EyAngband's
      birth screen that again is probably based on ZAngband's birth screen.
    - Select the sex, race, and class choices from a dead character as
      defaults for a new character.
    - Added a stripped down version of Takeshi Mogami's "auto_dump" feature
      from Hengband.  Automatic pref file dumps from the game are now
      marked, so that they can be replaced when dumping to the same
      pref-file again.
    - Allow the banishment spell to be aborted at the "Choose a monster race
      to banish" prompt without using up a scroll or charge.
    - Added John Rauser's monster list patch that allows the user to display
      a list of the visible monsters in a window.
    - Improved the navigation in the help files.
    - Recharging wands or staves that have been fully *identified* before
      will now automatically reveal the new number of charges in the device.
      This fixes a bug where an already *ID'ed* wand or staff couldn't be
      *ID'ed* again after recharging (but plain ID works), despite the
      number of charges being unknown. (bug reported by Eddie Grove)
    - text_to_ascii() didn't check that the characters used in \xAB
      sequences represent real hex characters.  Invalid hex sequences are
      now converted to the '?' character. (reported by Kieron Dunbar)
    - Improved the handling of incomplete '\x' sequences in macros.  The old
      code could skip the final NUL-byte of the string if it ended with
      '\x', leading to a potential buffer overflow.
    - Fixed a typo in the description of the "wild cat". (Jay McAbee)
    - Monster groups ignored their fear when the smart_packs option was
      turned on. (reported by Eddie Grove)
    - Rods and staves of probing are no longer automatically identified when
      used without a monster nearby. (reported by "someog")
    - Prevent the player from being hit multiple times by area effect spells
      and breaths that can blink the player (nexus, gravity).
    - The player can now get a level feeling when entering level 1 without
      spending 1000 game turns in town first. (Tom Houser)
    - Branding ammo or weapons will now automatically try to combine and
      reorder the resulting objects, even if the enchantment of to-hit and
      to-dam fails. (reported by John D. Goulden)
    - Try to output minor warning messages (such as "illegal option choice"
      when selecting a non existing item for a command) as soon as possible.
      (reported by "Mogami")
    - Show all minor error messages immediately in the message window.
    - The effects of light spells are only obvious if you aren't blind.
    - Wands and rods of light don't give a message and aren't automatically
      identified when using them while blind. (reported by Steve Kroon)
    - Refilling a latern from a stack of laterns will now only use the oil
      from one latern, not from the whole stack. (reported by Jay McAbee)
    - Prevent earthquake/destruction spells from working in town.  This
      prevents inappropriate messages (like "The cave ceiling collapses!").
    - Automatically try to load the "Kobold.prf" file at startup if the
      player is a Kobold.
    - Improved the output of item and monster descriptions in spoilers and
      character dumps.  In some cases punctuation and spaces were wrapped to
      the next line.
    - The basic object spoilers only reported the prices for unidentified
      items.  (reported by Hugo Kornelis)
    - Only print the "You feel (less) resistant to ..." messages when not
      immune to the specific element. (reported by Jeff Greene)
    - The cursor keys in the X11 ports behave the same way now, no matter if
      num-lock is on or off.
    - Change colors in main-gcu.c. This is Dominik Grzelak's patch to change
      bright white from blue back to bright white. (Ed Cogburn)
    - Added a workaround for a bug in the curses version with USE_GETCH.
      The news.txt screen was erased by the first call to the getch()
      function. (Frank Palazzolo)
    - Angband consumed 100% of the cpu while waiting for a keypress in the
      GTK port. (Sheldon Simms)
    - Allow text to be copied from the game window in the X11 port.
      (modified version of the code in Kieron Dunbar's sCthangband 1.0.10)
    - Added transparency support to the 32x32 tiles in the Windows port.
      This requires a modified tiles bitmap and a new transparency mask
      originally created by Andrew Doull:
      ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Extra/graf-32x32-304.zip
    - Removed the hackish 'Show scores' menu entry from the Windows version.
      Use the new knowledge menu entry instead.
    - Applied lots of Mac specific patches by "pelpel".
    - Allow initialization of the game to continue, even if the
      lib/data/*.raw files can't be written.  In that case the data parsed
      from the lib/edit/*.txt files stays in memory and is used instead of
      the *.raw data.  This currently wastes some memory, since the text
      arrays are not resized to the minimum required length.
    - Added a performance tweak for the Angband Borg.
    - Increased the data-type of the shopkeeper purse limit from signed
      16 bit to signed 32 bit.  This will allow shopkeepers with a higher
      limit than 32768 gold to be added.
    - Added a compile time option to store the savefiles and scores in the
      player's home directory (under ~/.angband/Angband/) on multi-user
      machines.
    - Use a different delay function in the DOS version that works around
      the restricted 55ms resolution on Windows 2000 and XP.

  * New upstream bug fixing version. Changes:
     - Fixed a bug in the text-output routines used for character dumps that
       sometimes introduced bogus output. (reported by Pasi Vartiainen)
     - Fixed a wrong entry in the template for the X11 startup shell script.
       ("Mynstral")
     - Fixed the display of *slays* in character dumps. (Matthias Kurzke)
     - The "It might have hidden powers." message will now displayed in the
       character dumps.  This makes it easier to see if an artifact or ego-item
       with random abilities has already been *identified*.
     - Curses on unidentified items are no longer revealed in character dumps 
       or in the output of the 'Inspect' command.
     - Fixed a typo - "intellegence". (Greg Stark)
  * Make sure the package contains /var/games/angband/file/news.txt

  * Creatures in wall can no longer be attacked by moving into them, you
    have to tunnel.
  * Defenders and Holy avengers now sustain one random stat.
  * Some Slay evil and slay undead weapons boost the wielder's wisdom.
  * Some Slay Animal and Slay Demon weapons boost the wielder's intelligence.
  * Some Slay Orc weapons boost the wielder's dexterity.
  * Some Slay Troll and Slay Giant weapons boost the wielder's strength.
  * Robes of the Magi are now called the robes of permanence.
  * Optionally, you may have the monsters retain things they steal from
    you; killing them will let you get your things back.
  * You may let multiple items stack on the florr; no more items
    disappearing. 
  * You will no longer be asked about the numbers of items to sell, buy,
    drop, or get; the default is 1, and you have to specify a number (0
    followed by digits) of objects to act upon. (I really hate this

    directories stay in /usr/lib/games, the variable or run time stuff
    is in /var/lib/games, and editable or modifiable data is in /etc, 
    and whole directories under the lib structure may be moved around by
    changing make variables, with symlinks back to the /var are and
    automagikal generation of conffiles. This package now conforms to 
    the FSSTND.

  * Added a postinst to help move /usr/lib/games/angband to the new location
    /var/lib/games/angband.
  * Modified rules to track lib dir changes in config.h, so that
    it only needs be changed in one place.
  * Change lib location yet again to /var. The reason is that /usr may
    be read only, and angband does not just write score files, it also
    writes raw data files,bones files, save files, and pref files; so
    it was easier to move the whole dir.  Also, configuring the code to 
    look for files in different directories is cumbersome, and prone to
    error. This fixes BUG#6148.
